He understood terrible purposes .
They drove against all <unk> .
They were their own necessity .
Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose .
He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was .
&quot; Some day , lad , &quot; the old woman said , &quot; you , too , may have to stand outside a door like that .
It takes a measure of doing . &quot;
Paul looked down at the hand that had known pain , then up to the Reverend Mother .
The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other voice in his experience .
The words were outlined in <unk> .
There was an edge to them .
He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his <unk> into something greater .
&quot; Why do you test for humans ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; To set you free . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free .
But that only permitted other men with machines to <unk> them . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man &apos;s mind , &apos; &quot; Paul quoted .
&quot; Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible , &quot; she said .
&quot; But what the O.C.
Bible should &apos;ve said is : &apos; Thou shalt not make a machine to <unk> a human mind . &apos;
Have you studied the Mentat in your service ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve studied with Thufir Hawat . &quot;
&quot; The Great Revolt took away a <unk> , &quot; she said .
&quot; It forced human minds to develop .
<unk> were started to train human talents . &quot;
&quot; Bene Gesserit schools ? &quot;
She nodded .
&quot; We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools : the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild .
The Guild , so we think , <unk> almost pure <unk> .
Bene Gesserit <unk> another function . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; Kull wahad ! &quot;
the old woman said .
She sent a hard glance at Jessica .
&quot; I &apos;ve not told him .
Your Reverence , &quot; Jessica said .
The Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul .
&quot; You did that on <unk> few clues , &quot; she said .
&quot; <unk> indeed .
The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of <unk> in human affairs .
They saw there could be no such <unk> without separating human stock from animal stock -- for breeding purposes . &quot;
The old woman &apos;s words abruptly lost their special <unk> for Paul .
He felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t that Reverend Mother lied to him .
She obviously believed what she said .
It was something deeper , something tied to his terrible purpose .
He said : &quot; But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don &apos;t know their ancestry . &quot;
&quot; The genetic lines are always in our <unk> , &quot; she said .
&quot; Your mother knows that either she &apos;s of Bene Gesserit <unk> or her stock was <unk> in itself . &quot;
&quot; Then why couldn &apos;t she know who her <unk> are ? &quot;
&quot; Some do .
.
.
Many don &apos;t .
We might , for example , have wanted to <unk> her to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait .
We have many reasons . &quot;
Again , Paul felt the offense against <unk> .
He said : &quot; You take a lot on yourselves . &quot;
The Reverend Mother stared at him , wondering : Did I hear criticism in his voice ?
&quot; We carry a heavy burden , &quot; she said .
Paul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test .
He leveled a measuring stare at her , said : &quot; You say maybe I &apos;m the .
.
.
Kwisatz Haderach .
What &apos;s that , a human gom jabbar ? &quot;
&quot; Paul , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; You mustn &apos;t take that tone with -- &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll handle this , Jessica , &quot; the old woman said .
&quot; Now , lad , do you know about the Truthsayer drug ? &quot;
&quot; You take it to <unk> your ability to detect falsehood , &quot; he said .
&quot; My mother &apos;s told me . &quot;
&quot; Have you ever seen truthtrance ? &quot;
He shook his head .
&quot; No . &quot;
&quot; The drug &apos;s dangerous , &quot; she said , &quot; but it gives insight .
When a Truthsayer &apos;s gifted by the drug , she can look many places in her memory -- in her body &apos;s memory .
We look down so many avenues of the past .
.
.
but only feminine avenues . &quot;
Her voice took on a note of sadness .
&quot; Yet , there &apos;s a place where no Truthsayer can see .
We are repelled by it , <unk> .
It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye .
He will look where we cannot -- into both feminine and <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Your Kwisatz Haderach ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , the one who can be many places at once : the Kwisatz Haderach .
Many men have tried the drug .
.
.
so many , but none has succeeded . &quot;
&quot; They tried and failed , all of them ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , no . &quot;
She shook her head .
&quot; They tried and died . &quot;
= = = = = = To attempt an understanding of Muad &apos;Dib without understanding his mortal enemies , the Harkonnens , is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing <unk> .
It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing <unk> .
It cannot be .
-from &quot; Manual of Muad &apos;Dib &quot; by the Princess Irulan It was a relief globe of a world , partly in shadows , spinning under the <unk> of a fat hand that glittered with rings .
The globe sat on a <unk> stand at one wall of a <unk> room whose other walls presented a <unk> of multicolored <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in <unk> suspensor fields .
An <unk> desk with a top of <unk> <unk> elacca wood stood at the center of the room .
<unk> suspensor chairs ringed it , two of them occupied .
In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years , round of face and with sullen eyes .
The other held a slender , short man with <unk> face .
Both youth and man stared at the globe and the man <unk> in shadows spinning it .
A chuckle sounded beside the globe .
A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle : &quot; There it is , Piter -- the <unk> <unk> in all history .
And the Duke &apos;s headed into its <unk> .
Is it not a <unk> thing that I , the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen , do ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , Baron , &quot; said the man .
His voice came out tenor with a sweet , musical quality .
The fat hand descended onto the globe , stopped the spinning .
Now , all eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind of globe made for <unk> collectors or planetary <unk> of the Empire .
It had the stamp of Imperial <unk> about it .
<unk> and <unk> lines were laid in with <unk> <unk> wire .
The polar caps were <unk> of finest <unk> <unk> .
The fat hand moved , tracing <unk> on the surface .
&quot; I invite you to observe , &quot; the basso voice rumbled .
&quot; Observe closely , Piter , and you , too , Feyd-Rautha , my darling : from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south -- these exquisite ripples .
Their <unk> : does it not remind you of sweet <unk> ?
And nowhere do you see blue of <unk> or rivers or seas .
And these lovely polar caps -- so small .
Could anyone mistake this place ?
Arrakis !
<unk> unique .
A superb setting for a unique <unk> . &quot;
A smile touched Piter &apos;s lips .
&quot; And to think .
Baron : the Padishah Emperor believes he &apos;s given the Duke your spice planet .
How <unk> . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a <unk> statement , &quot; the Baron rumbled .
&quot; You say this to confuse young Feyd-Rautha , but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew . &quot;
The <unk> youth stirred in his chair , smoothed a <unk> in the black <unk> he wore .
He sat upright as a <unk> <unk> sounded at the door in the wall behind him .
Piter <unk> from his chair , crossed to the door , cracked it wide enough to accept a message cylinder .
He closed the door , <unk> the cylinder and scanned it .
A chuckle sounded from him .
Another .
&quot; Well ? &quot;
the Baron demanded .
&quot; The fool answered us , Baron ! &quot;
&quot; Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture ? &quot;
the Baron asked .
&quot; Well , what does he say ? &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s most <unk> , Baron .
<unk> you as &apos; Harkonnen &apos; -- no &apos; Sire <unk> <unk> <unk> , &apos; no title , nothing . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a good name , &quot; the Baron growled , and his voice betrayed his impatience .
&quot; What does dear Leto say ? &quot;
&quot; He says : &apos; Your offer of a meeting is refused .
I have <unk> met your treachery and this all men know . &apos;
&quot; &quot; And ? &quot;
the Baron asked .
&quot; He says : &apos; The art of kanly still has <unk> in the Empire . &apos;
He signs it : &apos; Duke Leto of Arrakis . &apos;
&quot; Piter began to laugh .
&quot; Of Arrakis !
Oh , my !
This is almost too rich ! &quot;
&quot; Be silent , Piter , &quot; the Baron said , and the laughter stopped as though shut off with a switch .
&quot; Kanly , is it ? &quot;
the Baron asked .
&quot; <unk> , heh ?
And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it . &quot;
&quot; You made the peace gesture , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; The forms have been obeyed . &quot;
&quot; For a Mentat , you talk too much , Piter , &quot; the Baron said .
And he thought : I must do away with that one soon .
He has almost <unk> his usefulness .
The Baron stared across the room at his <unk> assassin , seeing the feature about him that most people noticed first : the eyes , the shaded slits of blue within blue , the eyes without any white in them at all .
A grin flashed across Piter &apos;s face .
It was like a mask grimace beneath those eyes like <unk> .
&quot; But , Baron !
Never has revenge been more beautiful .
It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery : to make Leto exchange Caladan for Dune -- and without alternative because the Emperor orders it .
How <unk> of you ! &quot;
In a cold voice , the Baron said : &quot; You have a <unk> of the mouth , Piter . &quot;
&quot; But I am happy , my Baron .
<unk> you .
.
.
you are touched by jealousy . &quot;
&quot; Piter ! &quot;
&quot; <unk> .
Baron !
Is it not <unk> you were unable to <unk> this delicious scheme by yourself ? &quot;
&quot; Someday I will have you strangled , Piter . &quot;
&quot; Of a certainty , Baron .
<unk> !
But a kind act is never lost , eh ? &quot;
&quot; Have you been chewing <unk> or semuta , Piter ? &quot;
&quot; Truth without fear <unk> the Baron , &quot; Piter said .
His face drew down into a caricature of a frowning mask .
&quot; Ah , hah !
But you see , Baron , I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner .
You will hold back just so long as I am useful .
To move sooner would be wasteful and I &apos;m yet of much use .
I know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet -- waste not .
True , Baron ? &quot;
The Baron continued to stare at Piter .
Feyd-Rautha <unk> in his chair .
These <unk> fools !
he thought .
My uncle cannot talk to his <unk> without <unk> .
Do they think I &apos;ve nothing to do except listen their arguments ?
&quot; Feyd , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; I told you to listen and learn when I <unk> you in here .
Are you learning ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , Uncle . &quot;
the voice was carefully <unk> .
&quot; Sometimes I wonder about Piter , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; I cause pain out of necessity , but he .
.
.
I swear he takes a positive <unk> in it .
For myself , I can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto .
Dr. Yueh will move against him soon , and that &apos;ll be the end of all the Atreides .
But surely Leto will know whose hand directed the <unk> doctor .
.
.
and knowing that will be a terrible thing . &quot;
&quot; Then why haven &apos;t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his <unk> quietly and <unk> ? &quot;
Piter asked .
&quot; You talk of pity , but -- &quot; &quot; The Duke must know when I encompass his doom , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; And the other Great Houses must learn of it .
The knowledge will give them pause .
I &apos;ll gain a bit more room to maneuver .
The necessity is obvious , but I don &apos;t have to like it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> to maneuver , &quot; Piter sneered .
&quot; Already you have the Emperor &apos;s eyes on you , Baron .
You move too <unk> .
One day the Emperor will send a legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that &apos;ll be an end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;d like to see that , wouldn &apos;t you , Piter ? &quot;
the Baron asked .
&quot; You &apos;d enjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar <unk> through my cities and sack this castle .
You &apos;d truly enjoy that . &quot;
&quot; Does the Baron need to ask ? &quot;
Piter whispered .
&quot; You should &apos;ve been a Bashar of the Corps , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; You &apos;re too interested in blood and pain .
Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the <unk> of Arrakis . &quot;
Piter took five <unk> <unk> steps into the room , stopped directly behind Feyd-Rautha .
There was a tight air of tension in the room , and the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown .
&quot; Do not toy with Piter , Baron , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; You promised me the Lady Jessica .
You promised her to me . &quot;
&quot; For what , Piter ? &quot;
the Baron asked .
&quot; For pain ? &quot;
Piter stared at him , dragging out the silence .
Feyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side , said : &quot; Uncle , do I have to stay ?
You said you &apos;d -- &quot; &quot; My darling Feyd-Rautha grows <unk> , &quot; the Baron said .
He moved within the shadows beside the globe .
&quot; <unk> , Feyd . &quot;
And he turned his attention back to the Mentat .
&quot; What of the <unk> , the child Paul , my dear Piter ? &quot;
&quot; The trap will bring him to you , Baron , &quot; Piter muttered .
&quot; That &apos;s not my question , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; You &apos;ll recall that you <unk> the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke .
You were wrong , eh , Mentat ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not often wrong , Baron , &quot; Piter said , and for the first time there was fear in his voice .
&quot; Give me that : I &apos;m not often wrong .
And you know yourself these Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters .
Even the Emperor &apos;s consort had produced only <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Uncle , &quot; said Feyd-Rautha , &quot; you said there &apos;d be something important here for me to -- &quot; &quot; Listen to my nephew , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; He <unk> to rule my <unk> , yet he cannot rule himself . &quot;
The Baron stirred beside the globe , a shadow among shadows .
&quot; Well then , Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen , I summoned you here hoping to teach you a bit of wisdom .
Have you observed our good Mentat ?
You should &apos;ve learned something from this exchange . &quot;
&quot; But , Uncle -- &quot; &quot; A most efficient Mentat , Piter , wouldn &apos;t you say , Feyd ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , but -- &quot; &quot; Ah !
Indeed but !
But he <unk> too much spice , <unk> it like <unk> .
Look at his eyes !
He might &apos;ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool .
Efficient , Piter , but he &apos;s still emotional and <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Efficient , Piter , but he still can <unk> . &quot;
Piter spoke in a low , sullen tone : &quot; Did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism , Baron ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> your efficiency ?
You know me better , Piter .
I wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat . &quot;
&quot; Are you already training my replacement ? &quot;
Piter demanded .
&quot; <unk> you ?
Why , Piter , where could I find another Mentat with your cunning and venom ? &quot;
&quot; The same place you found me , Baron . &quot;
&quot; Perhaps I should at that , &quot; the Baron mused .
&quot; You do seem a bit unstable lately .
And the spice you eat ! &quot;
&quot; Are my pleasures too expensive , Baron ?
Do you object to them ? &quot;
&quot; My dear Piter , your pleasures are what tie you to me .
How could I object to that ?
I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you . &quot;
&quot; Then I &apos;m on <unk> , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; Shall I dance ?
Shall I perform my various functions for the <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; You are on <unk> .
Now , be silent . &quot;
He glanced at Feyd-Rautha , noting his nephew &apos;s lips , the full and <unk> look of them , the Harkonnen genetic marker , now twisted slightly in <unk> .
&quot; This is a Mentat , Feyd .
It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties .
The fact that it &apos;s <unk> in a human body , however , must not be overlooked .
A serious <unk> , that .
I sometimes think the <unk> with their thinking machines had the right idea . &quot;
&quot; They were toys <unk> to me , &quot; Piter snarled .
&quot; You yourself , Baron , could <unk> those machines . &quot;
&quot; Perhaps , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; Ah , well .
.
. &quot;
He took a deep breath , <unk> .
&quot; Now , Piter , outline for my nephew the <unk> features of our campaign against the House of Atreides .
<unk> as a Mentat for us , if you please . &quot;
&quot; Baron , I &apos;ve warned you not to trust one so young with this information .
My <unk> of -- &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be the judge of this , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; I give you an order , Mentat .
<unk> one of your various functions . &quot;
&quot; So be it , &quot; Piter said .
He straightened , <unk> an odd attitude of dignity -- as though it were another mask , but this time clothing his entire body .
&quot; In a few days Standard , the entire household of the Duke Leto will <unk> on a Spacing Guild <unk> for Arrakis .
The Guild will <unk> them at the city of Arrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag .
The Duke &apos;s Mentat , Thufir Hawat , will have <unk> <unk> that Arrakeen is easier to defend . &quot;
&quot; Listen carefully , Feyd , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; Observe the plans within plans within plans . &quot;
Feyd-Rautha nodded , thinking : This is more like it .
The old monster is letting me in on secret things at last .
He must really mean for me to be his heir .
&quot; There are several <unk> possibilities , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; I indicate that House Atreides will go to Arrakis .
We must not , however , ignore the possibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place of safety outside the <unk> .
Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses , taking family atomics and shields and <unk> beyond the Imperium . &quot;
&quot; The Duke &apos;s too proud a man for that , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; It is a possibility , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; The ultimate effect for us would be the same , however . &quot;
&quot; No , it would not ! &quot;
the Baron growled .
&quot; I must have him dead and his line ended . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s the high <unk> , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; There are certain preparations that indicate when a House is going renegade .
The Duke appears to be doing none of these things . &quot;
&quot; So , &quot; the Baron sighed .
&quot; Get on with it , Piter . &quot;
&quot; At Arrakeen , &quot; Piter said , &quot; the Duke and his family will occupy the Residency , lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring . &quot;
&quot; The Ambassador to the Smugglers , &quot; the Baron chuckled .
&quot; Ambassador to what ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha asked .
&quot; Your uncle makes a joke , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to the Smugglers , <unk> the Emperor &apos;s interest in <unk> operations on Arrakis . &quot;
Feyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle .
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be dense , Feyd , &quot; the Baron snapped .
&quot; As long as the Guild remains <unk> outside Imperial control , how could it be otherwise ?
How else could spies and assassins move about ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha &apos;s mouth made a <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve arranged <unk> at the Residency , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; There &apos;ll be an attempt on the life of the Atreides heir -- an attempt which could succeed . &quot;
&quot; Piter , &quot; the Baron rumbled , &quot; you indicated -- &quot; &quot; I indicated accidents can happen , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; And the attempt must appear <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Ah , but the lad has such a sweet young body , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; Of course , he &apos;s <unk> more dangerous than the father .
.
.
with that witch mother training him .
<unk> woman !
Ah , well , please continue , Piter . &quot;
&quot; Hawat will have <unk> that we have an agent planted on him , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh , who is indeed our agent .
But Hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School <unk> with Imperial Conditioning -- <unk> safe enough to <unk> even to the Emperor .
Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning .
It &apos;s <unk> that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject .
However , as someone once observed , given the right lever you can move a planet .
We found the lever that moved the doctor . &quot;
&quot; How ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha asked .
He found this a <unk> subject .
Everyone knew you couldn &apos;t <unk> Imperial Conditioning !
&quot; Another time , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; <unk> , Piter . &quot;
&quot; In place of Yueh , &quot; Piter said , &quot; we &apos;ll drag a most interesting suspect across Hawat &apos;s path .
The very <unk> of this suspect will <unk> her to Hawat &apos;s attention . &quot;
&quot; Her ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha asked .
&quot; The Lady Jessica herself , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; Is it not <unk> ? &quot;
Piter asked .
&quot; Hawat &apos;s mind will be so filled with this <unk> it &apos;ll impair his function as a Mentat .
He may even try to kill her . &quot;
Piter frowned , then : &quot; But I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll be able to carry it off . &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t want him to , eh ? &quot;
the Baron asked .
&quot; Don &apos;t distract me , &quot; Piter said .
&quot; While Hawat &apos;s occupied with the Lady Jessica , we &apos;ll divert him further with <unk> in a few garrison towns and the like .
These will be put down .
The Duke must believe he &apos;s <unk> a measure of security .
Then , when the moment is <unk> , we &apos;ll signal Yueh and move in with our major force .
.
.
