Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus ? &quot;
&quot; The land is beautiful , true , &quot; Chani said .
&quot; But there is much grief in it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> is the price of victory , &quot; Jessica said .
Is she <unk> me for grief ?
Chani asked herself .
She said : &quot; There are so many women without men .
There was jealousy when it was learned that I &apos;d been summoned north . &quot;
&quot; I summoned you , &quot; Jessica said .
Chani felt her heart <unk> .
She wanted to <unk> her hands to her ears , fearful of what they might hear .
Still , she kept her voice even : &quot; The message was signed Muad &apos;Dib . &quot;
&quot; I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; It was a <unk> of necessity . &quot;
And Jessica thought : This is a brave woman , my Paul &apos;s .
She holds to the <unk> even when fear is almost <unk> her .
Yes .
She may be the one we need now .
Only the slightest tone of <unk> crept into Chani &apos;s voice as she said : &quot; Now you may say the thing that must be said . &quot;
&quot; You were needed here to help me <unk> Paul , &quot; Jessica said .
And she thought : There !
I said it in the precisely correct way .
<unk> .
Thus she knows Paul is alive and knows there is peril , all in the same word .
Chani took only a moment to calm herself , then : &quot; What is it I may do ? &quot;
She wanted to leap at Jessica , shake her and scream : &quot; Take me to him ! &quot;
But she waited silently for the answer .
&quot; I suspect , &quot; Jessica said , &quot; that the Harkonnens have managed to send an agent among us to poison Paul .
It &apos;s the only explanation that seems to fit .
A most unusual poison .
I &apos;ve examined his blood in the most subtle ways without <unk> it . &quot;
Chani thrust herself forward onto her knees .
&quot; Poison ?
Is he in pain ?
Could I .
.
. &quot;
&quot; He is unconscious , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; The <unk> of his life are so low that they can be detected only with the most <unk> <unk> .
I shudder to think what could have happened had I not been the one to discover him .
He appears dead to the <unk> eye . &quot;
&quot; You have reasons other than courtesy for <unk> me , &quot; Chani said .
&quot; I know you , Reverend Mother .
What is it you think I may do that you cannot do ? &quot;
She is brave , lovely and , ah-h-h , so <unk> , Jessica thought .
She &apos;d have made a fine Bene Gesserit .
&quot; Chani , &quot; Jessica said , &quot; you may find this difficult to believe , but I do not know precisely why I sent for you .
It was an instinct .
.
.
a basic <unk> .
The thought came <unk> : &apos; Send for Chani . &apos;
&quot; For the first time , Chani saw the sadness in Jessica &apos;s expression , the <unk> pain <unk> the inward stare .
&quot; I &apos;ve done all I know to do , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; That all .
.
.
it is so far beyond what is usually supposed as all that you would find difficulty <unk> it .
Yet .
.
.
I failed . &quot;
&quot; The old companion , Halleck , &quot; Chani asked , &quot; is it possible he &apos;s a traitor ? &quot;
&quot; Not Gurney , &quot; Jessica said .
The two words carried an entire conversation , and Chani saw the searching , the tests .
.
.
the memories of old <unk> that went into this flat <unk> .
Chani <unk> back onto her feet , stood up , smoothed her <unk> robe .
&quot; Take me to him , &quot; she said .
Jessica arose , turned through hangings on the left wall .
Chani followed , found herself in what had been a <unk> , its rock walls concealed now beneath heavy draperies .
Paul lay on a field pad against the far wall .
A single glowglobe above him illuminated his face .
A black robe covered him to the chest , leaving his arms outside it stretched along his sides .
He appeared to be <unk> under the robe .
The skin exposed looked <unk> , rigid .
There was no visible movement to him .
Chani suppressed the desire to dash forward , throw herself across him .
She found her thoughts , instead , going to her son -- Leto .
And she realized in this instant that Jessica once had faced such a moment -- her man threatened by death , forced in her own mind to consider what might be done to save a young son .
The realization formed a sudden bond with the older woman so that Chani reached out and clasped Jessica &apos;s hand .
The answering grip was painful in its intensity .
&quot; He lives , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; I assure you he lives .
But the thread of his life is so thin it could easily escape <unk> .
There are some among the leaders already muttering that the mother speaks and not the Reverend Mother , that my son is truly dead and I do not want to give up his water to the tribe . &quot;
&quot; How long has he been this way ? &quot;
Chani asked .
She disengaged her hand from Jessica &apos;s , moved farther into the room .
&quot; Three weeks , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; I spent almost a week trying to <unk> him .
There were <unk> , arguments .
.
.
<unk> .
Then I sent for you .
The Fedaykin obey my orders , else I might not have been able to delay the .
.
. &quot;
She wet her lips with her tongue , watching Chani cross to Paul .
Chani stood over him now , looking down on the soft beard of youth that framed his face , tracing with her eyes the high <unk> , the strong nose , the <unk> eyes -- the features so <unk> in this rigid repose .
&quot; How does he take <unk> ? &quot;
Chani asked .
&quot; The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; How many know of what has happened ? &quot;
Chani asked .
&quot; Only his closest <unk> , a few of the leaders , the Fedaykin and , of course , whoever administered the poison . &quot;
&quot; There is no clue to the <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; And it &apos;s not for want of <unk> , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; What do the Fedaykin say ? &quot;
Chani asked .
&quot; They believe Paul is in a sacred <unk> , gathering his holy powers before the final battles .
This is a thought I &apos;ve <unk> . &quot;
Chani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad , bent close to Paul &apos;s face .
She sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face .
.
.
but it was only the spice , the <unk> spice whose odor permeated everything in Fremen life .
Still .
.
.
&quot; You were not born to the spice as we were , &quot; Chani said .
&quot; Have you investigated the possibility that his body has <unk> against too much spice in his diet ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> reactions are all negative , &quot; Jessica said .
She closed her eyes , as much to <unk> out this scene as because of sudden realization of fatigue .
How long have I been without sleep ?
she asked herself .
Too long .
&quot; When you change the Water of Life , &quot; Chani said , &quot; you do it within yourself by the inward awareness .
Have you used this awareness to test his blood ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> Fremen blood , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; <unk> adapted to the diet and the life here . &quot;
Chani sat back on her heels , <unk> her fears in thought as she studied Paul &apos;s face .
This was a trick she had learned from watching the Reverend Mothers .
Time could be made to serve the mind .
One concentrated the entire attention .
Presently , Chani said : &quot; Is there a maker here ? &quot;
&quot; There are several , &quot; Jessica said with a touch of weariness .
&quot; We are never without them these days .
Each victory requires its blessing .
Each ceremony before a raid -- &quot; &quot; But Paul Muad &apos;Dib has held himself <unk> from these <unk> , &quot; Chani said .
Jessica nodded to herself , remembering her son &apos;s <unk> feelings toward the spice drug and the prescient awareness it <unk> .
&quot; How did you know this ? &quot;
Jessica asked .
&quot; It is spoken . &quot;
&quot; Too much is spoken , &quot; Jessica said bitterly .
&quot; Get me the raw Water of the maker , &quot; Chani said .
Jessica stiffened at the tone of command in Chani &apos;s voice , then observed the intense concentration in the younger woman and said : &quot; At once . &quot;
She went out through the hangings to send a <unk> .
Chani sat staring at Paul .
If he has tried to do this , she thought .
And it &apos;s the sort of thing he might try .
.
.
Jessica knelt beside Chani , holding out a plain camp <unk> .
The charged odor of the poison was sharp in Chani &apos;s nostrils .
She dipped a finger in the fluid , held the finger close to Paul &apos;s nose .
The skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled slightly .
Slowly , the nostrils flared .
Jessica gasped .
Chani touched the <unk> finger to Paul &apos;s upper lip .
He drew in a long , <unk> breath .
&quot; What is this ? &quot;
Jessica demanded .
&quot; Be still , &quot; Chani said .
&quot; You must <unk> a small amount of the sacred water .
Quickly ! &quot;
Without questioning , because she recognized the tone of awareness in Chani &apos;s voice , Jessica lifted the <unk> to her mouth , drew in a small sip .
Paul &apos;s eyes flew open .
He stared upward at Chani .
&quot; It is not necessary for her to change the Water , &quot; he said .
His voice was weak , but steady .
Jessica , a sip of the fluid on her tongue , found her body <unk> , <unk> the poison almost <unk> .
In the light <unk> the ceremony always <unk> , she sensed the <unk> from Paul -- a <unk> there registering on her senses .
In that instant , she knew .
&quot; You <unk> the sacred water ! &quot;
she blurted .
&quot; One drop of it , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; So small .
.
.
one drop . &quot;
&quot; How could you do such a foolish thing ? &quot;
she demanded .
&quot; He is your son , &quot; Chani said .
Jessica glared at her .
A rare smile , warm and full of understanding , touched Paul &apos;s lips .
&quot; <unk> my beloved , &quot; he said .
&quot; Listen to her , Mother .
She knows . &quot;
&quot; A thing that others can do , he must do , &quot; Chani said .
&quot; When I had the drop in my mouth , when I felt it and smelled it , when I knew what it was doing to me , then I knew I could do the thing that you have done , &quot; he said .
&quot; Your Bene Gesserit <unk> speak of the Kwisatz Haderach , but they cannot begin to guess the many places I have been .
In the few minutes I .
.
. &quot;
He broke off , looking at Chani with a puzzled frown .
&quot; Chani ?
How did you get here ?
You &apos;re supposed to be .
.
.
Why are you here ? &quot;
He tried to push himself onto his <unk> .
Chani pressed him back gently .
&quot; Please , my Usul , &quot; she said .
&quot; I feel so weak , &quot; he said .
His gaze darted around the room .
&quot; How long have I been here ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve been three weeks in a <unk> so deep that the spark of life seemed to have fled , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; But it was .
.
.
I took it just a moment ago and .
.
. &quot;
&quot; A moment for you , three weeks of fear for me , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; It was only one drop , but I <unk> it , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; I changed the Water of Life . &quot;
And before Chani or Jessica could stop him , he dipped his hand into the <unk> they had placed on the floor beside him , and he brought the dripping hand to his mouth , swallowed the <unk> liquid .
&quot; Paul ! &quot;
Jessica screamed .
He grabbed her hand , faced her with a death &apos;s head grin , and he sent his awareness <unk> over her .
The <unk> was not as tender , not as sharing , not as <unk> as it had been with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern .
.
.
but it was a <unk> : a <unk> of the entire being .
It shook her , <unk> her , and she <unk> in her mind , fearful of him .
<unk> , he said : &quot; You speak of a place where you cannot enter ?
This place which the Reverend Mother cannot face , show it to me . &quot;
She shook her head , terrified by the very thought .
&quot; Show it to me ! &quot;
he commanded .
&quot; No ! &quot;
But she could not escape him .
<unk> by the terrible force of him , she closed her eyes and focused inward -- <unk> .
Paul &apos;s consciousness flowed through and around her and into the darkness .
She glimpsed the place dimly before her mind blanked itself away from the terror .
Without knowing why , her whole being trembled at what she had seen -- a region where a wind <unk> and <unk> glared , where rings of light <unk> and contracted , where <unk> of <unk> white shapes flowed over and under and around the lights , driven by darkness and a wind out of nowhere .
Presently , she opened her eyes , saw Paul staring up at her .
He still held her hand , but the terrible <unk> was gone .
She <unk> her trembling .
Paul released her hand .
It was as though some <unk> had been removed .
She staggered up and back , would have fallen had not Chani jumped to support her .
&quot; Reverend Mother ! &quot;
Chani said .
&quot; What is wrong ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; Jessica whispered .
&quot; So .
.
.
tired . &quot;
&quot; Here , &quot; Chani said .
&quot; Sit here . &quot;
She helped Jessica to a cushion against the wall .
The strong young arms felt so good to Jessica .
She clung to Chani .
&quot; He has , in truth , seen the Water of Life ? &quot;
Chani asked .
She disengaged herself from Jessica &apos;s grip .
&quot; He has seen , &quot; Jessica whispered .
Her mind still rolled and surged from the contact .
It was like <unk> to solid land after weeks on a <unk> sea .
She sensed the old Reverend Mother within her .
.
.
and all the others awakened and questioning ; &quot; What was that ?
What happened ?
Where was that place ? &quot;
Through it all <unk> the realization that her son was the Kwisatz Haderach , the one who could be many places at once .
He was the fact out of the Bene Gesserit dream .
And the fact gave her no peace .
&quot; What happened ? &quot;
Chani demanded .
Jessica shook her head .
Paul said : &quot; There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives .
A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force <unk> , but it &apos;s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man .
For a woman , the situation is <unk> . &quot;
Jessica looked up , found Chani was staring at her while listening to Paul .
&quot; Do you understand me , Mother ? &quot;
Paul asked .
She could only nod .
&quot; These things are so ancient within us , &quot; Paul said , &quot; that they &apos;re ground into each separate cell of our bodies .
We &apos;re shaped by such forces .
You can say to yourself , &apos; Yes , I see how such a thing may be . &apos;
But when you look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded , you see your peril .
You see that this could <unk> you .
The greatest peril to the <unk> is the force that takes .
The greatest peril to the <unk> is the force that gives .
It &apos;s as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking . &quot;
&quot; And you , my son , &quot; Jessica asked , &quot; are you one who gives or one who takes ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m at the <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; I cannot give without taking and I cannot take without .
.
. &quot;
He broke off , looking to the wall at his right .
Chani felt a draft against her cheek , turned to see the hangings close .
&quot; It was Otheym , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; He was listening . &quot;
<unk> the words , Chani was touched by some of the prescience that <unk> Paul , and she knew a <unk> as though it already had occurred .
Otheym would speak of what he had seen and heard .
Others would spread the story until it was a fire over the land .
Paul-Muad &apos;Dib is not as other men , they would say .
There can be no more doubt .
He is a man , yet he sees through to the Water of Life in the way of a Reverend Mother .
He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib .
&quot; You have seen the future , Paul , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; Will you say what you &apos;ve seen ? &quot;
&quot; Not the future , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen the Now . &quot;
He forced himself to a sitting position , waved Chani aside as she moved to help him .
&quot; The <unk> above Arrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild . &quot;
Jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice .
&quot; The Padishah Emperor himself is there , &quot; Paul said .
He looked at the rock ceiling of his cell .
&quot; With his favorite Truthsayer and five legions of Sardaukar .
The old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is there with Thufir Hawat beside him and seven ships <unk> with every <unk> he could <unk> .
Every Great House has its raiders above us .
.
.
waiting . &quot;
Chani shook her head , unable to look away from Paul .
His strangeness , the flat tone of voice , the way he looked through her , filled her with awe .
Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat , said : &quot; For what are they waiting ? &quot;
Paul looked at her .
&quot; For the Guild &apos;s permission to land .
The Guild will <unk> on Arrakis any force that <unk> without permission . &quot;
&quot; The Guild &apos;s <unk> us ? &quot;
Jessica asked .
&quot; <unk> us !
The Guild itself caused this by spreading <unk> about what we do here and by <unk> troop transport <unk> to a point where even the <unk> Houses are up there now waiting to <unk> us . &quot;
Jessica noted the lack of bitterness in his tone , wondered at it .
She couldn &apos;t doubt his words -- they had that same intensity she &apos;d seen in him the night he &apos;d revealed the path of the future that &apos;d taken them among the Fremen .
Paul took a deep breath , said : &quot; Mother , you must change a <unk> of the Water for us .
We need the <unk> .
Chani , have a <unk> force sent out .
.
.
to find a pre-spice mass .
If we plant a <unk> of the Water of Life above a pre-spice mass , do you know what will happen ? &quot;
Jessica weighed his words , suddenly saw through to his meaning .
&quot; Paul ! &quot;
she gasped .
&quot; The Water of Death , &quot; he said .
&quot; It &apos;d be a chain reaction . &quot;
He pointed to the floor .
&quot; <unk> death among the little makers , killing a <unk> of the life cycle that <unk> the spice and the makers .
Arrakis will become a true <unk> -- without spice or maker . &quot;
Chani put a hand to her mouth , shocked to <unk> silence by the <unk> pouring from Paul &apos;s lips .
&quot; He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; We can destroy the spice . &quot;
&quot; What <unk> the Guild &apos;s hand ? &quot;
Jessica whispered .
&quot; They &apos;re searching for me , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Think of that !
The finest Guild navigators , men who can <unk> ahead through time to find the safest course for the <unk> <unk> , all of them seeking me .
.
<unk> unable to find me .
How they tremble !
They know I have their secret here ! &quot;
Paul held out his cupped hand .
&quot; Without the spice they &apos;re blind ! &quot;
Chani found her voice .
&quot; You said you see the now ! &quot;
Paul lay back , searching the <unk> present , its limits extended into the future and into the past , holding onto the awareness with difficulty as the spice illumination began to <unk> .
&quot; Go do as I commanded , &quot; he said .
&quot; The future &apos;s becoming as <unk> for the Guild as it is for me .
The lines of vision are <unk> .
Everything <unk> here where the spice is .
.
.
where they &apos;ve dared not interfere before .
.
.
because to interfere was to lose what they must have .
But now they &apos;re desperate .
All paths lead into darkness . &quot;
= = = = = = And that day <unk> when Arrakis lay at the <unk> of the universe with the wheel poised to <unk> .
-from &quot; Arrakis Awakening &quot; by the Princess Irulan &quot; Will you look at that thing ! &quot;
Stilgar whispered .
Paul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the Shield Wall rim , eye fixed to the <unk> of a Fremen telescope .
The oil lens was focused on a <unk> lighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them .
The tall eastern face of the ship glistened in the flat light of the sun , but the shadow side still showed yellow <unk> from glowglobes of the night .
Beyond the ship , the city of Arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun .
It wasn &apos;t the lighter that excited Stilgar &apos;s awe , Paul knew , but the <unk> for which the lighter was only the <unk> .
A single metal hutment , many stories tall , reached out in a <unk> circle from the base of the lighter -- a tent composed of <unk> metal leaves -- the temporary <unk> place for five legions of Sardaukar and His Imperial Majesty , the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV .
From his position squatting at Paul &apos;s left , Gurney Halleck said : &quot; I count nine levels to it .
Must be quite a few Sardaukar in there . &quot;
&quot; Five legions , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; It grows light , &quot; Stilgar hissed .
&quot; We like it not , your exposing yourself , Muad &apos;Dib .
Let us go back into the rocks now . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m perfectly safe here , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; That ship <unk> projectile weapons , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; They believe us <unk> by shields , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They wouldn &apos;t waste a shot on an <unk> <unk> even if they saw us . &quot;
Paul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin , seeing the <unk> cliffs , the <unk> that marked the <unk> of so many of his father &apos;s troopers .
And he had a <unk> sense of the <unk> of things that the <unk> of those men should look down on this moment .
The Harkonnen <unk> and towns across the shielded <unk> lay in Fremen hands or cut away from their source like <unk> <unk> from a plant and left to <unk> .
Only this basin and its city remained to the enemy .
&quot; They might try a <unk> by &apos; thopter , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; If they see us . &quot;
&quot; Let them , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; We &apos;ve &apos; thopters to <unk> today .
.
.
and we know a storm is coming . &quot;
He swung the telescope to the far side of the Arrakeen landing field now , to the Harkonnen frigates lined up there with a CHOAM Company banner waving gently from its staff on the ground beneath them .
And he thought of the desperation that had forced the Guild to permit these two groups to land while all the others were held in reserve .
The Guild was like a man testing the sand with his toe to <unk> its temperature before <unk> a tent .
&quot; Is there anything new to see from here ? &quot;
Gurney asked .
&quot; We should be getting under cover .
The storm is coming . &quot;
Paul returned his attention on the giant hutment .
&quot; They &apos;ve even brought their women , &quot; he said .
&quot; And lackeys and servants .
Ah-h-h , my dear Emperor , how confident you are . &quot;
&quot; Men are coming up the secret way , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; It may be Otheym and Korba returning . &quot;
&quot; All right , Stil , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; We &apos;ll go back . &quot;
But he took one final look around through the telescope -- studying the plain with its tall ships , the gleaming metal hutment , the silent city , the frigates of the Harkonnen mercenaries .
Then he slid backward around a <unk> of rock .
His place at the telescope was taken by a Fedaykin <unk> .
Paul emerged into a shallow depression in the Shield Wall &apos;s surface .
It was a place about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deep , a natural feature of the rock that the Fremen had hidden beneath a <unk> camouflage cover .
<unk> equipment was <unk> around a hole in the wall to the right .
Fedaykin guards <unk> through the depression waited for Muad &apos;Dib &apos;s command to attack .
Two men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment , spoke to the guards there .
Paul glanced at Stilgar , nodded in the direction of the two men .
&quot; Get their report , Stil . &quot;
Stilgar moved to obey .
Paul crouched with his back to the rock , stretching his muscles , straightened .
He saw Stilgar sending the two men back into that dark hole in the rock , thought about the long climb down that narrow <unk> tunnel to the floor of the basin .
Stilgar crossed to Paul .
&quot; What was so important that they couldn &apos;t send a cielago with the message ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; They &apos;re saving their birds for the battle , &quot; Stilgar said .
He glanced at the communications equipment , back to Paul .
&quot; Even with a tight beam , it is wrong to use those things , Muad &apos;Dib .
They can find you by taking a <unk> on its <unk> . &quot;
&quot; They &apos;ll soon be too busy to find me , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; What did the men report ? &quot;
&quot; Our <unk> Sardaukar have been released near Old <unk> low on the rim and are on their way to their master .
The <unk> <unk> and other projectile weapons are in place .
The people are <unk> as you ordered .
It was all routine . &quot;
Paul glanced across the shallow bowl , studying his men in the filtered light admitted by the camouflage cover .
He felt time creeping like an insect working its way across an exposed rock .
&quot; It &apos;ll take our Sardaukar a little time <unk> before they can signal a troop carrier , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They are being watched ? &quot;
&quot; They are being watched , &quot; Stilgar said .
Beside Paul , Gurney Halleck cleared his throat .
&quot; <unk> &apos;t we best be getting to a place of safety ? &quot;
&quot; There is no such place , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Is the weather report still favorable ? &quot;
&quot; A great <unk> of a storm coming , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; Can you not feel it , Muad &apos;Dib ? &quot;
&quot; The air does feel <unk> , &quot; Paul agreed .
&quot; But I like the certainty of <unk> the weather . &quot;
&quot; The storm &apos;ll be here in the hour , &quot; Stilgar said .
He nodded toward the gap that looked out on the Emperor &apos;s hutment and the Harkonnen frigates .
&quot; They know it there , too .
Not a &apos; thopter in the sky .
Everything pulled in and tied down .
They &apos;ve had a report on the weather from their friends in space . &quot;
&quot; Any more probing <unk> ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; Nothing since the landing last night , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; They know we &apos;re here .
I think now they wait to choose their own time . &quot;
&quot; We choose the time , &quot; Paul said .
Gurney glanced upward , growled : &quot; If they let us . &quot;
&quot; That <unk> &apos;ll stay in space , &quot; Paul said .
Gurney shook his head .
&quot; They have no choice , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; We can destroy the spice .
The Guild <unk> not risk that . &quot;
&quot; <unk> people are the most dangerous , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; Are we not desperate ? &quot;
Stilgar asked .
Gurney scowled at him .
&quot; You haven &apos;t lived with the Fremen dream , &quot; Paul cautioned .
&quot; Stil is thinking of all the water we &apos;ve spent on bribes , the years of waiting we &apos;ve added before Arrakis can bloom .
He &apos;s not -- &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; Gurney scowled .
&quot; Why &apos;s he so <unk> ? &quot;
Stilgar asked .
&quot; He &apos;s always <unk> before a battle , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; It &apos;s the only form of good humor Gurney <unk> himself . &quot;
A slow , <unk> grin spread across Gurney &apos;s face , the teeth showing white above the chip cup of his stillsuit .
&quot; It <unk> me much to think on all the poor Harkonnen <unk> we &apos;ll dispatch <unk> , &quot; he said .
Stilgar chuckled .
&quot; He talks like a Fedaykin . &quot;
&quot; Gurney was born a death <unk> , &quot; Paul said .
And he thought : Yes , let them occupy their minds with small talk be <unk> we test ourselves against that force on the plain .
He looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to Gurney , found that the <unk> had resumed a <unk> scowl .
&quot; <unk> <unk> the strength , &quot; Paul murmured .
&quot; You told me that once , Gurney . &quot;
&quot; My Duke , &quot; Gurney said , &quot; my chief worry is the atomics .
If you use them to blast a hole in the Shield Wall .
.
. &quot;
&quot; Those people up there won &apos;t use atomics against us , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They don &apos;t dare .
.
.
and for the same reason that they cannot risk our destroying the source of the spice . &quot;
&quot; But the <unk> against -- &quot; &quot; The <unk> ! &quot;
Paul barked .
&quot; It &apos;s fear , not the <unk> that keeps the Houses from hurling atomics against each other .
The language of the Great Convention is clear enough : &apos; Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration . &apos;
We &apos;re going to blast the Shield Wall , not humans . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s too fine a point , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; The <unk> up there will welcome any point , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Let &apos;s talk no more about it . &quot;
He turned away , <unk> he actually felt that confident .
Presently , he said : &quot; What about the city people ?
Are they in position yet ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; Stilgar muttered .
Paul looked at him .
&quot; What &apos;s eating you ? &quot;
&quot; I never knew the city man could be trusted completely , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; I was a city man myself once , &quot; Paul said .
Stilgar stiffened .
His face grew dark with blood .
&quot; Muad &apos;Dib knows I did not mean -- &quot; &quot; I know what you meant , Stil .
But the test of a man isn &apos;t what you think he &apos;ll do .
It &apos;s what he actually does .
These city people have Fremen blood .
It &apos;s just that they haven &apos;t yet learned how to escape their <unk> .
We &apos;ll teach them . &quot;
Stilgar nodded , spoke in a <unk> tone : &quot; The <unk> of a lifetime , Muad &apos;Dib .
On the <unk> <unk> we learned to despise the men of the communities . &quot;
Paul glanced at Gurney , saw him studying Stilgar .
&quot; Tell us , Gurney , why were the city folk down there driven from their <unk> by the Sardaukar ? &quot;
&quot; An old trick , my Duke .
They thought to burden us with <unk> . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s been so long since <unk> were <unk> that the <unk> have forgotten how to fight them , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; The Sardaukar have played into our hands .
They grabbed some city women for their sport , <unk> their battle <unk> with the heads of the men who <unk> .
And they &apos;ve built up a <unk> of hate among people who otherwise would &apos;ve looked on the coming battle as no more than a great <unk> .
.
.
and the possibility of <unk> one set of masters for another .
The Sardaukar <unk> for us , Stilgar . &quot;
&quot; The city people do seem eager , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; Their hate is fresh and clear , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; That &apos;s why we use them as shock troops . &quot;
&quot; The <unk> among them will be fearful , &quot; Gurney said .
Stilgar nodded agreement .
&quot; They were told the <unk> , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They know every Sardaukar they kill will be one less for us .
You see , gentlemen , they have something to die for .
They &apos;ve discovered they &apos;re a people .
They &apos;re awakening . &quot;
A muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope .
Paul moved to the rock slit , asked : &quot; What is it out there ? &quot;
&quot; A great <unk> , Muad &apos;Dib , &quot; the watcher hissed .
&quot; At that monstrous metal tent .
A surface <unk> came from <unk> <unk> and it was like a hawk into a nest of rock <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Our captive Sardaukar have arrived , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They &apos;ve a shield around the entire landing field now , &quot; the watcher said .
&quot; I can see the air dancing even to the edge of the storage <unk> where they kept the spice . &quot;
&quot; Now they know who it is they fight , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; Let the Harkonnen beasts tremble and <unk> themselves that an Atreides yet lives ! &quot;
Paul spoke to the Fedaykin at the telescope .
&quot; Watch the <unk> atop the Emperor &apos;s ship .
If my flag is raised there -- &quot; &quot; It will not be , &quot; Gurney said .
Paul saw the puzzled frown on Stilgar &apos;s face , said : &quot; If the Emperor recognized my claim , he &apos;ll signal by <unk> the Atreides flag to Arrakis .
We &apos;ll use the second plan then , move only against the Harkonnens .
The Sardaukar will stand aside and let us settle the issue between ourselves . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve no experience with these offworld things , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; I &apos;ve heard of them , but it seems <unk> the -- &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t need experience to know what they &apos;ll do , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; They &apos;re sending a new flag up on the tall ship , &quot; the watcher said .
&quot; The flag is yellow .
.
.
with a black and red circle in the center . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s a subtle piece of business , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; The CHOAM Company flag . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the same as the flag at the other ships , &quot; the Fedaykin guard said .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; A subtle piece of business indeed , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; Had he sent up the Atreides banner , he &apos;d have had to live by what that meant .
Too many observers about .
He could &apos;ve signaled with the Harkonnen flag on his staff -- a flat <unk> that &apos;d have been .
But , no -- he sends up the CHOAM <unk> .
He &apos;s telling the people up there .
.
. &quot;
Gurney pointed toward space . &quot;
.
.
.
where the profit is .
He &apos;s saying he doesn &apos;t care if it &apos;s an Atreides here or not . &quot;
&quot; How long <unk> the storm <unk> the Shield Wall ? &quot;
Paul asked .
Stilgar turned away , <unk> one of the Fedaykin in the bowl .
Presently , he returned , said : &quot; Very soon , Muad &apos;Dib .
<unk> than we expected .
It &apos;s a <unk> of a storm .
.
.
perhaps even more than you wished . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s my storm , &quot; Paul said , and saw the silent awe on the faces of the Fedaykin who heard him .
&quot; <unk> it shook the entire world it could not be more than I wished .
Will it strike the Shield Wall full on ? &quot;
&quot; Close enough to make no difference , &quot; Stilgar said .
A courier crossed from the hole that led down into the basin , said : &quot; The Sardaukar and Harkonnen patrols are pulling back , Muad &apos;Dib . &quot;
&quot; They expect the storm to spill too much sand into the basin for good visibility , &quot; Stilgar <unk> .
&quot; They think we &apos;ll be in the same fix . &quot;
&quot; Tell our <unk> to set their <unk> well before visibility <unk> , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They must knock the nose off every one of those ships as soon as the storm has destroyed the shields . &quot;
He stepped to the wall of the bowl , pulled back a fold of the camouflage cover and looked up at the sky .
The <unk> <unk> of blow sand could be seen against the dark of the sky .
Paul restored the cover , said : &quot; <unk> sending our men down , Stil . &quot;
&quot; Will you not go with us ? &quot;
Stilgar asked .
&quot; I &apos;ll wait here a bit with the Fedaykin , &quot; Paul said .
Stilgar gave a knowing shrug toward Gurney , moved to the hole in the rock wall , was lost in its shadows .
&quot; The trigger that <unk> the Shield Wall aside , that I leave in your hands , Gurney , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; You will do it ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll do it . &quot;
Paul gestured to a Fedaykin lieutenant , said : &quot; Otheym , start moving the check patrols out of the blast area .
They must be out of there before the storm <unk> . &quot;
The man bowed , followed Stilgar .
Gurney leaned in to the rock slit , spoke to the man at the telescope : &quot; Keep your attention on the south wall .
It &apos;ll be completely <unk> until we blow it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> a cielago with a time signal , &quot; Paul ordered .
&quot; Some ground <unk> are moving toward the south wall , &quot; the man at the telescope said .
&quot; Some are using projectile weapons , testing .
Our people are using body shields as you commanded .
The ground <unk> have stopped . &quot;
In the abrupt silence , Paul heard the wind devils playing overhead -- the front of the storm .
Sand began to <unk> down into their bowl through <unk> in the cover .
A burst of wind caught the cover , whipped it away .
Paul motioned his Fedaykin to take shelter , crossed to the men at the communications equipment near the tunnel mouth .
Gurney stayed beside him .
Paul crouched over the <unk> .
One said : &quot; A <unk> <unk> of a storm , Muad &apos;Dib . &quot;
Paul glanced up at the <unk> sky , said : &quot; Gurney , have the south wall observers pulled out . &quot;
He had to repeat his order , shouting above the growing noise of the storm .
Gurney turned to obey .
Paul fastened his face filter , tightened the stillsuit hood .
Gurney returned .
Paul touched his shoulder , pointed to the blast trigger set into the tunnel mouth beyond the <unk> .
Gurney went into the tunnel , stopped there , one hand at the trigger , his gaze on Paul .
&quot; We are getting no messages , &quot; the signalman beside Paul said .
&quot; Much static . &quot;
Paul nodded , kept his eye on the <unk> <unk> in front of the signalman .
Presently , Paul looked at Gurney , raised a hand , returned his attention to the <unk> .
The time counter crawled around its final <unk> .
&quot; Now ! &quot;
Paul shouted , and dropped his hand .
Gurney <unk> the blast trigger .
It seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath them ripple and shake .
A rumbling sound was added to the storm &apos;s roar .
The Fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside Paul , the telescope clutched under one arm .
&quot; The Shield Wall is <unk> , Muad &apos;Dib ! &quot;
he shouted .
&quot; The storm is on them and our <unk> already are <unk> . &quot;
Paul thought of the storm sweeping across the basin , the static charge within the wall of sand that destroyed every shield barrier in the enemy camp .
&quot; The storm ! &quot;
someone shouted .
&quot; We must get under cover , Muad &apos;Dib ! &quot;
Paul came to his senses , feeling the sand <unk> <unk> his exposed cheeks .
We are committed , he thought .
He put an arm around the signalman &apos;s shoulder , said : &quot; Leave the equipment !
There &apos;s more in the tunnel . &quot;
He felt himself being pulled away , Fedaykin pressed around him to protect him .
They squeezed into the tunnel mouth , feeling its <unk> silence , turned a corner into a small chamber with glowglobes overhead and another tunnel opening beyond .
Another signalman sat there at his equipment .
&quot; Much static , &quot; the man said .
A <unk> of sand filled the air around them .
&quot; <unk> off this tunnel ! &quot;
Paul shouted .
A sudden pressure of stillness showed that his command had been obeyed .
&quot; Is the way down to the basin still open ? &quot;
Paul asked .
A Fedaykin went to look , returned , said : &quot; The explosion caused a little rock to fall , but the <unk> say it is still open .
They &apos;re <unk> up with <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Tell them to use their hands ! &quot;
Paul barked .
&quot; There are shields <unk> down there ? &quot;
&quot; They are being careful , Muad &apos;Dib , &quot; the man said , but he turned to obey .
The <unk> from outside pressed past them carrying their equipment .
&quot; I told those men to leave their equipment ! &quot;
Paul said .
&quot; Fremen do not like to abandon equipment , Muad &apos;Dib , &quot; one of his Fedaykin <unk> .
&quot; Men are more important than equipment now , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; We &apos;ll have more equipment than we can use soon or have no need for any equipment . &quot;
Gurney Halleck came up beside him , said : &quot; I heard them say the way down is open .
We &apos;re very close to the surface here , m &apos;Lord , should the Harkonnens try to <unk> in kind . &quot;
&quot; They &apos;re in no position to <unk> , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They &apos;re just now finding out that they have no shields and are unable to get off Arrakis . &quot;
&quot; The new command post is all prepared , though , m &apos;Lord , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; They &apos;ve no need of me in the command post yet , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; The plan would go ahead without me .
We must wait for the -- &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting a message , Muad &apos;Dib , &quot; said the signalman at the communications equipment .
The man shook his head , pressed a receiver <unk> against his ear .
&quot; Much static ! &quot;
He began <unk> on a pad in front of him , shaking his head waiting , <unk> .
.
.
waiting .
Paul crossed to the signalman &apos;s side .
The Fedaykin stepped back , giving him room .
He looked down at what the man had written , read : &quot; <unk> .
.
.
on Sietch Tabr .
.
.
<unk> .
.
.
Alia ( blank ) families of ( blank ) dead are .
.
.
they ( blank ) son of Muad &apos;Dib .
.
. &quot;
Again , the signalman shook his head .
Paul looked up to see Gurney staring at him .
&quot; The message is <unk> , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; The static .
You don &apos;t know that .
.
. &quot;
&quot; My son is dead , &quot; Paul said , and knew as he spoke that it was true .
&quot; My son is dead .
.
.
and Alia is a captive .
.
.
<unk> . &quot;
He felt emptied , a <unk> without emotions .
Everything he touched brought death and grief .
And it was like a disease that could spread across the universe .
He could feel the <unk> wisdom , the <unk> out of the experiences from countless possible lives .
Something seemed to chuckle and rub its hands within him .
And Paul thought : How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty !
= = = = = = And Muad &apos;Dib stood before them , and he said : &quot; <unk> we <unk> the captive dead , yet does she live .
For her seed is my seed and her voice is my voice .
And she sees unto the <unk> reaches of possibility .
<unk> , unto the <unk> of the <unk> does she see because of me . &quot;
-from &quot; Arrakis Awakening &quot; by the Princess Irulan The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood with eyes <unk> in the Imperial audience chamber , the oval selamlik within the Padishah Emperor &apos;s hutment .
With <unk> glances , the Baron had studied the <unk> room and its occupants -- the <unk> , the pages , the guards , the troop of House Sardaukar drawn up around the walls , standing at ease there beneath the bloody and <unk> captured battle <unk> that were the room &apos;s only decoration .
<unk> sounded from the right of the chamber , <unk> out of a high passage : &quot; Make way !
Make way for the Royal <unk> ! &quot;
The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV came out of the passage into the audience chamber followed by his suite .
He stood waiting while his throne was brought , ignoring the Baron , seemingly ignoring every person in the room .
The Baron found that he could not ignore the Royal <unk> , and studied the Emperor for a sign , any clue to the purpose of this audience .
The Emperor stood poised , waiting -- a <unk> , <unk> figure in a gray Sardaukar uniform with silver and gold <unk> .
His thin face and cold eyes reminded the Baron of the Duke Leto long dead .
There was that same look of the predatory bird .
But the Emperor &apos;s hair was red , not black , and most of that hair was concealed by a <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> with the Imperial crest in gold upon its <unk> .
<unk> brought the throne .
It was a <unk> chair carved from a single piece of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> shot through with <unk> of yellow fire .
They placed it on the dais and the Emperor mounted , seated himself .
An old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead detached herself from the Emperor &apos;s suite , took up station behind the throne , one <unk> hand resting on the <unk> back .
Her face peered out of the hood like a witch caricature -- <unk> cheeks and eyes , an <unk> nose , skin <unk> and with protruding <unk> .
The Baron stilled his trembling at sight of her .
The presence of the Reverend Mother <unk> Helen Mohiam , the Emperor &apos;s Truthsayer , betrayed the importance of this audience .
The Baron looked away from her , studied the suite for a clue .
There were two of the Guild agents , one tall and fat , one short and fat , both with <unk> gray eyes .
And among the lackeys stood one of the Emperor &apos;s daughters , the Princess Irulan , a woman they said was being trained in the deepest of the Bene Gesserit ways , <unk> to be a Reverend Mother .
She was tall , <unk> , face of <unk> beauty , green eyes that looked past and through him .
&quot; My dear Baron . &quot;
The Emperor had <unk> to notice him .
The voice was <unk> and with exquisite control .
It managed to dismiss him while greeting him .
The Baron bowed low , advanced to the required position ten paces from the dais .
&quot; I came at your summons , Majesty . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
the old witch <unk> .
&quot; Now , Reverend Mother , &quot; the Emperor <unk> , but he smiled at the Baron &apos;s <unk> , said : &quot; First , you will tell me where you &apos;ve sent your <unk> , Thufir Hawat . &quot;
The Baron darted his gaze left and right , <unk> himself for coming here without his own guards , not that they &apos;d be much use against Sardaukar .
Still .
.
.
&quot; Well ? &quot;
the Emperor said .
&quot; He has been gone these five days , Majesty . &quot;
The Baron shot a glance at the Guild agents , back to the Emperor .
&quot; He was to land at a smuggler base and attempt infiltrating the camp of the Fremen fanatic , this Muad &apos;Dib . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
the Emperor said .
One of the witch &apos;s <unk> hands tapped the Emperor &apos;s shoulder .
She leaned forward , whispered in his ear .
The Emperor nodded , said : &quot; Five days , Baron .
Tell me , why aren &apos;t you worried about his absence ? &quot;
&quot; But I am worried , Majesty ! &quot;
The Emperor continued to stare at him , waiting .
The Reverend Mother emitted a <unk> laugh .
&quot; What I mean , Majesty , &quot; the Baron said , &quot; is that Hawat will be dead within another few hours , anyway . &quot;
And he explained about the latent poison and need for an antidote .
&quot; How clever of you , Baron , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; And where are your <unk> , Rabban and the young Feyd-Rautha ? &quot;
&quot; The storm comes , Majesty .
I sent them to inspect our perimeter lest the Fremen attack under cover of the sand . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; the Emperor said .
The word came out as though it <unk> his mouth .
&quot; The storm won &apos;t be much here in the basin , and that Fremen rabble won &apos;t attack while I &apos;m here with five legions of Sardaukar . &quot;
&quot; Surely not , Majesty , &quot; the Baron said , &quot; But error on the side of caution cannot be <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Ah-h-h-h , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; <unk> .
Then I &apos;m not to speak of how much time this Arrakis nonsense has taken from me ?
Nor the CHOAM Company profits pouring down this <unk> hole ?
Nor the <unk> functions and affairs of state I &apos;ve had to delay -- even <unk> -- because of this stupid affair ? &quot;
The Baron lowered his gaze , frightened by the Imperial anger .
The <unk> of his position here , alone and dependent upon the Convention and the <unk> <unk> of the Great Houses , <unk> him .
Does he mean to kill me ?
the Baron asked himself .
He couldn &apos;t !
Not with the other Great Houses waiting up there , aching for any excuse to gain from this upset on Arrakis .
&quot; Have you taken <unk> ? &quot;
the Emperor asked .
&quot; It &apos;s useless , Majesty , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; These mad Fremen hold a <unk> ceremony for every captive and act as though such a one were already dead . &quot;
&quot; So ? &quot;
the Emperor said .
And the Baron waited , <unk> left and right at the metal walls of the selamlik , thinking of the monstrous <unk> tent around him .
Such <unk> wealth it represented that even the Baron was awed .
He brings pages , the Baron thought , and useless <unk> lackeys , his women and their companions -- <unk> , <unk> , everything .
.
.
all the <unk> <unk> of the Court .
All here -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> it &quot; with the Emperor .
.
.
here to watch him put an end to this affair , to make <unk> over the battles and <unk> the wounded .
&quot; Perhaps you &apos;ve never sought the right kind of <unk> , &quot; the Emperor said .
He knows something , the Baron thought .
Fear sat like a stone in his stomach until he could hardly bear the thought of eating .
Yet , the feeling was like hunger , and he poised himself several times in his suspensors on the point of <unk> food brought to him .
But there was no one here to obey his summons .
&quot; Do you have any idea who this Muad &apos;Dib could be ? &quot;
the Emperor asked .
&quot; One of the <unk> , surely , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; A Fremen fanatic , a religious <unk> .
They crop up <unk> on the <unk> of civilization .
Your Majesty knows this . &quot;
The Emperor glanced at his Truthsayer , turned back to scowl at the Baron .
&quot; And you have no other knowledge of this Muad &apos;Dib ? &quot;
&quot; A madman , &quot; the Baron said .
&quot; But all Fremen are a little mad . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; His people scream his name as they leap into battle .
The women throw their <unk> at us and <unk> themselves onto our knives to open a wedge for their men to attack us .
They have no .
.
.
no .
.
.
<unk> ! &quot;
&quot; As bad as that , &quot; the Emperor murmured , and his tone of <unk> did not escape the Baron .
&quot; Tell me , my dear Baron , have you investigated the southern polar regions of Arrakis ? &quot;
The Baron stared up at the Emperor , shocked by the change of subject .
&quot; But .
.
.
well , you know , Your Majesty , the entire region is uninhabitable , open to wind and worm .
There &apos;s not even any spice in those latitudes . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve had no reports from spice lighters that patches of greenery appear there ? &quot;
&quot; There &apos;ve always been such reports .
Some were investigated -- long ago .
A few plants were seen .
Many &apos; thopters were lost .
Much too costly , Your Majesty .
It &apos;s a place where men cannot survive for long . &quot;
&quot; So , &quot; the Emperor said .
He snapped his fingers and a door opened at his left behind the throne .
Through the door came two Sardaukar <unk> a girl-child who appeared to be about four years old .
She wore a black aba , the hood thrown back to reveal the <unk> of a stillsuit hanging free at her throat .
Her eyes were Fremen blue , staring out of a soft , round face .
She appeared completely <unk> and there was a look to her stare that made the Baron feel uneasy for no reason he could explain .
Even the old Bene Gesserit Truthsayer drew back as the child passed and made a <unk> sign in her direction .
The old witch obviously was shaken by the child &apos;s presence .
The Emperor cleared his throat to speak , but the child spoke first -- a thin voice with traces of a <unk> <unk> , but clear nonetheless .
&quot; So here he is , &quot; she said .
She advanced to the edge of the dais .
&quot; He doesn &apos;t appear much , does he -- one frightened old fat man too weak to support his own flesh without the help of suspensors . &quot;
It was such a totally <unk> statement from the mouth of a child that the Baron stared at her , <unk> in spite of his anger .
Is it a <unk> ?
he asked himself .
&quot; My dear Baron , &quot; the Emperor said , &quot; become <unk> with the sister of Muad &apos;Dib . &quot;
&quot; The <unk> .
.
.
&quot; The Baron shifted his attention to the Emperor .
&quot; I do not understand . &quot;
&quot; I , too , sometimes <unk> on the side of caution , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; It has been reported to me that your <unk> south polar regions <unk> evidence of human activity . &quot;
&quot; But that &apos;s impossible ! &quot;
the Baron protested .
&quot; The worms .
.
.
there &apos;s sand clear to the .
.
. &quot;
&quot; These people seem able to avoid the worms , &quot; the Emperor said .
The child sat down on the dais beside the throne , <unk> her feet over the edge , kicking them .
There was such an air of <unk> in the way she <unk> her <unk> .
The Baron stared at the kicking feet , the way they moved the black robe , the wink of <unk> beneath the fabric .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; the Emperor said , &quot; I only sent in five troop <unk> with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning .
We barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier .
<unk> you , Baron , my Sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women , children , and old men .
This child here was in command of one of the attacking groups . &quot;
&quot; You see , Your Majesty ! &quot;
the Baron said .
&quot; You see how they are ! &quot;
&quot; I allowed myself to be captured , &quot; the child said .
&quot; I did not want to face my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed . &quot;
&quot; Only a handful of our men got away , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; Got away !
You hear that ? &quot;
&quot; We &apos;d have had them , too , &quot; the child said , &quot; except for the flames . &quot;
&quot; My Sardaukar used the <unk> <unk> on their carrier as <unk> , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; A move of desperation and the only thing that got them away with their three prisoners .
<unk> that , my dear Baron : Sardaukar forced to retreat in confusion from women and children and old men ! &quot;
&quot; We must attack in force , &quot; the Baron rasped .
&quot; We must destroy every last <unk> of -- &quot; &quot; Silence ! &quot;
the Emperor roared .
He pushed himself forward on his throne .
&quot; Do not <unk> my intelligence any longer .
You stand there in your foolish <unk> and -- &quot; &quot; Majesty , &quot; the old Truthsayer said .
He waved her to silence .
&quot; You say you don &apos;t know about the activity we found , nor the fighting qualities of these superb people ! &quot;
The Emperor lifted himself half off his throne .
&quot; What do you take me for , Baron ? &quot;
The Baron took two backward steps , thinking : It was Rabban .
He has done this to me .
Rabban has .
.
.
&quot; And this <unk> dispute with Duke Leto , &quot; the Emperor <unk> , sinking back into his throne .
&quot; How beautifully you <unk> it . &quot;
&quot; Majesty , &quot; the Baron pleaded .
&quot; What are you -- &quot; &quot; Silence ! &quot;
The old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor &apos;s shoulder , leaned close to whisper in his ear .
The child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet , said : &quot; Make him afraid some more , Shaddam .
I shouldn &apos;t enjoy this , but I find the pleasure impossible to suppress . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , child , &quot; the Emperor said .
He leaned forward , put a hand on her head , stared at the Baron .
&quot; Is it possible , Baron ?
Could you be as <unk> as my Truthsayer suggests ?
Do you not recognize this child , daughter of your ally , Duke Leto ? &quot;
&quot; My father was never his ally , &quot; the child said .
&quot; My father is dead and this old Harkonnen beast has never seen me before . &quot;
The Baron was reduced to <unk> glaring .
When he found his voice it was only to <unk> : &quot; Who ? &quot;
&quot; I am Alia , daughter of Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica , sister of Duke Paul-Muad &apos;Dib , &quot; the child said .
She pushed herself off the dais , dropped to the floor of the audience chamber .
&quot; My brother has promised to have your head atop his battle standard and I think he shall . &quot;
&quot; Be hush , child , &quot; the Emperor said , and he sank back into his throne , hand to chin , studying the Baron .
&quot; I do not take the Emperor &apos;s orders , &quot; Alia said .
She turned , looked up at the old Reverend Mother .
&quot; She knows . &quot;
The Emperor glanced up at his Truthsayer .
&quot; What does she mean ? &quot;
&quot; That child is an abomination ! &quot;
the old woman said .
&quot; Her mother deserves a punishment greater than anything in history .
Death !
It cannot come too quickly for that child or for the one who <unk> her ! &quot;
The old woman pointed a finger at Alia .
&quot; Get out of my mind ! &quot;
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
the Emperor whispered .
He snapped his attention back to Alia .
&quot; By the Great Mother ! &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t understand .
Majesty , &quot; the old woman said .
&quot; Not telepathy .
She &apos;s in my mind .
She &apos;s like the ones before me , the ones who gave me their memories .
She stands in my mind !
She cannot be there , but she is ! &quot;
&quot; What others ? &quot;
the Emperor demanded .
&quot; What &apos;s this nonsense ? &quot;
The old woman straightened , lowered her pointing hand .
&quot; I &apos;ve said too much , but the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed .
Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth , but one of our own has betrayed us . &quot;
&quot; You <unk> , old woman , &quot; Alia said .
&quot; You don &apos;t know how it was , yet you <unk> on like a <unk> fool . &quot;
Alia closed her eyes , took a deep breath , and held it .
The old Reverend Mother <unk> and staggered .
Alia opened her eyes .
&quot; That is how it was , &quot; she said .
&quot; A <unk> accident .
.
.
and you played your part in it . &quot;
The Reverend Mother held out both hands , palms pushing the air toward Alia .
&quot; What is happening here ? &quot;
the Emperor demanded .
&quot; Child , can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s not how it is at all , &quot; Alia said .
&quot; Unless I &apos;m born as you , I cannot think as you . &quot;
&quot; Kill her , &quot; the old woman muttered , and clutched the back of the throne for support .
&quot; Kill her ! &quot;
The <unk> old eyes glared at Alia .
&quot; Silence , &quot; the Emperor said , and he studied Alia .
&quot; Child , can you <unk> with your brother ? &quot;
&quot; My brother knows I &apos;m here , &quot; Alia said .
&quot; Can you tell him to <unk> as the price of your life ? &quot;
Alia smiled up at him with clear <unk> .
&quot; I shall not do that , &quot; she said .
The Baron stumbled forward to stand beside Alia .
&quot; Majesty , &quot; he pleaded , &quot; I knew nothing of -- &quot; &quot; <unk> me once more , Baron , &quot; the Emperor said , &quot; and you will lose the powers of <unk> .
.
.
forever . &quot;
He kept his attention focused on Alia , studying her through <unk> <unk> .
&quot; You will not , eh ?
Can you read in my mind what I &apos;ll do if you <unk> me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve already said I cannot read minds , &quot; she said , &quot; but one doesn &apos;t need telepathy to read your <unk> . &quot;
The Emperor scowled .
&quot; Child , your cause is <unk> .
I have but to <unk> my forces and reduce this planet to -- &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not that simple , &quot; Alia said .
She looked at the two Guildsmen .
&quot; <unk> them . &quot;
&quot; It is not wise to go against my desires , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; You should not deny me the least thing . &quot;
&quot; My brother comes now , &quot; Alia said .
&quot; Even an Emperor may tremble before Muad &apos;Dib , for he has the strength of <unk> and heaven smiles upon him . &quot;
The Emperor surged to his feet .
&quot; This play has gone far enough .
I will take your brother and this planet and <unk> them to -- &quot; The room rumbled and shook around them .
There came a sudden cascade of sand behind the throne where the hutment was <unk> to the Emperor &apos;s ship .
The abrupt <unk> of skin pressure told of a <unk> shield being activated .
&quot; I told you , &quot; Alia said .
&quot; My brother comes . &quot;
The Emperor stood in front of his throne , right hand pressed to right ear , the <unk> there chattering its report on the situation .
The Baron moved two steps behind Alia .
Sardaukar were leaping to positions at the doors .
&quot; We will fall back into space and <unk> , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; Baron , my <unk> .
These <unk> are attacking under cover of the storm .
We will show them an Emperor &apos;s wrath , then . &quot;
He pointed at Alia .
&quot; Give her body to the storm . &quot;
As he spoke , Alia fled backward , feigning terror : &quot; Let the storm have what it can take ! &quot;
she screamed .
And she backed into the Baron &apos;s arms .
&quot; I have her , Majesty ! &quot;
the Baron shouted .
&quot; Shall I dispatch her <unk> ! &quot;
He hurled her to the floor , clutched his left arm .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , <unk> , &quot; Alia said .
&quot; You &apos;ve met the Atreides gom jabbar . &quot;
She got to her feet , dropped a dark needle from her hand .
The Baron fell back .
His eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his left palm .
&quot; You .
.
.
you .
.
. &quot;
He rolled sideways in his suspensors , a <unk> mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head <unk> and mouth hanging open .
&quot; These people are <unk> , &quot; the Emperor snarled .
&quot; <unk> !
Into the ship .
We &apos;ll <unk> this planet of every .
.
. &quot;
Something <unk> to his left .
A roll of ball lightning <unk> away from the wall there , crackled as it touched the metal floor .
The smell of burned <unk> swept through the selamlik .
&quot; The shield ! &quot;
one of the Sardaukar officers shouted .
&quot; The outer shield is down !
They .
.
. &quot;
His words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the <unk> behind the Emperor trembled and <unk> .
&quot; They &apos;ve shot the nose off our ship ! &quot;
someone called .
Dust boiled through the room .
Under its cover , Alia leaped up , ran toward the outer door .
The Emperor whirled , motioned his people into an emergency door that swung open in the ship &apos;s side behind the throne .
He flashed a hand signal to a Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze .
&quot; We will make our stand here ! &quot;
the Emperor ordered .
Another <unk> shook the hutment .
The double doors banged open at the far side of the chamber <unk> <unk> sand and the sound of shouting .
A small , <unk> figure could be seen <unk> against the light -- Alia darting out to find a knife and , as <unk> her Fremen training , to kill Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded .
House Sardaukar charged through a <unk> yellow haze toward the opening , weapons ready , forming an arc there to protect the Emperor &apos;s retreat .
&quot; <unk> yourself , Sire ! &quot;
a Sardaukar officer shouted .
&quot; Into the ship ! &quot;
But the Emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors .
A <unk> <unk> of the hutment had been blasted away there and the selamlik &apos;s doors opened now onto <unk> sand .
A dust cloud hung low over the outside world blowing from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> lightning crackled from the cloud and the spark <unk> of shields being <unk> out by the storm &apos;s charge could be seen through the haze .
The plain surged with figures in combat -- Sardaukar and leaping <unk> robed men who seemed to come down out of the storm .
All this was as a frame for the target of the Emperor &apos;s pointing hand .
Out of the sand haze came an <unk> mass of flashing shapes -- great rising curves with crystal <unk> that <unk> into the <unk> <unk> of sandworms , a massed wall of them , each with troops of Fremen riding to the attack .
They came in a hissing wedge , robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the <unk> on the plain .
<unk> toward the Emperor &apos;s hutment they came while the House Sardaukar stood awed for the first time in their history by an <unk> their minds found difficult to accept .
But the figures leaping from the worm backs were men , and the blades flashing in that <unk> yellow light were a thing the Sardaukar had been trained to face .
They threw themselves into combat .
And it was man to man on the plain of Arrakeen while a picked Sardaukar <unk> pressed the Emperor back into the ship , sealed the door on him , and prepared to die at that door as part of his shield .
In the shock of <unk> silence within the ship , the Emperor stared at the wide-eyed faces of his suite , seeing his <unk> daughter with the flush of <unk> on her cheeks , the old Truthsayer standing like a black shadow with her hood pulled about her face , finding at last the faces he sought -- the two Guildsmen .
They wore the Guild gray , <unk> , and it seemed to fit the calm they maintained despite the high emotions around them .
The taller of the two , though , held a hand to his left eye .
As the Emperor watched , someone <unk> the Guildsman &apos;s arm , the hand moved , and the eye was revealed .
The man had lost one of his masking contact lenses , and the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost black .
The smaller of the pair <unk> his way a step <unk> the Emperor , said : &quot; We cannot know how it will go . &quot;
And the taller companion , hand restored to eye , added in a cold voice : &quot; But this Muad &apos;Dib cannot know , either . &quot;
The words shocked the Emperor out of his <unk> .
He checked the scorn on his tongue by a visible effort because it did not take a Guild <unk> &apos;s <unk> focus on the main chance to see the immediate future out on that plain .
Were these two so dependent upon their <unk> that they had lost the use of their eyes and their reason ?
he wondered .
&quot; Reverend Mother , &quot; he said , &quot; we must <unk> a plan . &quot;
She pulled the hood from her face , met his gaze with an <unk> stare .
The look that passed between them carried complete understanding .
They had one weapon left and both knew it : treachery .
&quot; <unk> Count Fenring from his quarters , &quot; the Reverend Mother said .
The Padishah Emperor nodded , waved for one of his aides to obey that command .
= = = = = = He was warrior and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , the fox and the innocent , <unk> , ruthless , less than a <unk> , more than a man .
There is no measuring Muad &apos;Dib &apos;s motives by ordinary <unk> .
In the moment of his <unk> , he saw the death prepared for him , yet he accepted the treachery .
Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice ?
<unk> justice , then ?
Remember , we speak now of the Muad &apos;Dib who ordered battle <unk> made from his enemies &apos; <unk> , the Muad &apos;Dib who denied the <unk> of his ducal past with a wave of the hand , saying merely : &quot; I am the Kwisatz Haderach .
That is reason enough . &quot;
-from &quot; Arrakis Awakening &quot; by the Princess Irulan It was to the Arrakeen governor &apos;s mansion , the old Residency the Atreides had first occupied on Dune , that they <unk> Paul-Muad &apos;Dib on the evening of his victory .
The building stood as Rabban had restored it , virtually untouched by the fighting although there had been <unk> by <unk> .
Some of the <unk> in the main hall had been <unk> or smashed .
Paul strode through the main entrance with Gurney Halleck and Stilgar a pace behind .
Their escort <unk> out into the Great Hall , <unk> the place and clearing an area for Muad &apos;Dib .
One squad began <unk> that no sly trap had been planted here .
&quot; I remember the day we first came here with your father , &quot; Gurney said .
He glanced around at the beams and the high , <unk> windows .
&quot; I didn &apos;t like this place then and I like it less now .
One of our caves would be safer . &quot;
&quot; <unk> like a true Fremen , &quot; Stilgar said , and he marked the cold smile that his words brought to Muad &apos;Dib &apos;s lips .
&quot; Will you <unk> , Muad &apos;Dib ? &quot;
&quot; This place is a symbol , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Rabban lived here .
By <unk> this place I seal my victory for all to understand .
Send men through the building .
<unk> nothing .
Just be certain no Harkonnen people or toys remain . &quot;
&quot; As you command , &quot; Stilgar said , and reluctance was heavy in his tone as he turned to obey .
<unk> men hurried into the room with their equipment , began setting up near the <unk> <unk> .
The Fremen guard that <unk> the <unk> Fedaykin took up stations around the room .
There was muttering among them , much darting of suspicious glances .
This had been too long a place of the enemy for them to accept their presence in it casually .
&quot; Gurney , have an escort bring my mother and Chani , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Does Chani know yet about our son ? &quot;
&quot; The message was sent , m &apos;Lord . &quot;
&quot; Are the makers being taken out of the basin yet ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , m &apos;Lord .
The storm &apos;s almost spent . &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s the extent of the storm damage ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; In the direct path -- on the landing field and across the spice storage <unk> of the plain -- extensive damage , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; As much from battle as from the storm . &quot;
&quot; Nothing money won &apos;t repair , I presume , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Except for the lives , m &apos;Lord , &quot; Gurney said , and there was a tone of <unk> in his voice as though to say : &quot; When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake ? &quot;
But Paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the <unk> visible to him in the <unk> that still lay across his path .
Through each gap the jihad raged away down the corridors of the future .
He sighed , crossed the hall , seeing a chair against the wall .
The chair had once stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own father .
At the moment , though , it was only an object to rest his weariness and conceal it from the men .
He sat down , pulling his robes around his legs , <unk> his stillsuit at the neck .
&quot; The Emperor is still <unk> up in the remains of his ship , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; For now , contain him there , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Have they found the Harkonnens yet ? &quot;
&quot; They &apos;re still <unk> the dead . &quot;
&quot; What reply from the ships up there ? &quot;
He jerked his chin toward the ceiling .
&quot; No reply yet , m &apos;Lord . &quot;
Paul sighed , resting against the back of his chair .
Presently , he said : &quot; Bring me a captive Sardaukar .
We must send a message to our Emperor , It &apos;s time to discuss terms . &quot;
&quot; Yes , m &apos;Lord . &quot;
Gurney turned away , dropped a hand signal to one of the Fedaykin who took up <unk> position beside Paul .
&quot; Gurney , &quot; Paul whispered .
&quot; Since we &apos;ve been <unk> I &apos;ve yet to hear you produce the proper quotation for the <unk> . &quot;
He turned , saw Gurney swallow , saw the sudden grim <unk> of the man &apos;s jaw .
&quot; As you wish , m &apos;Lord , &quot; Gurney said .
He cleared his throat , rasped : &quot; &apos; And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people : for the people heard say that day how the <unk> was <unk> for his son . &apos;
&quot; Paul closed his eyes , forcing grief out of his mind , letting it wait as he had once waited to mourn his father .
Now , he gave his thoughts over to this day &apos;s <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> futures and the hidden presence of Alia within his awareness .
Of all the uses of <unk> , this was the <unk> .
&quot; I have <unk> the future to place my words where only you can hear them , &quot; Alia had said .
&quot; Even you cannot do that , my brother .
I find it an interesting play .
And .
.
.
<unk> , yes -- I &apos;ve killed our grandfather , the <unk> old Baron .
He had very little pain . &quot;
Silence .
His time sense had seen her withdrawal .
&quot; Muad &apos;Dib . &quot;
Paul opened his eyes to see Stilgar &apos;s <unk> <unk> above him , the dark eyes glaring with battle light .
&quot; You &apos;ve found the body of the old Baron , &quot; Paul said .
A hush of the person settled over Stilgar .
&quot; How could you know ? &quot;
he whispered .
&quot; We just found the body in that great pile of metal the Emperor built . &quot;
Paul ignored the question , seeing Gurney return accompanied by two Fremen who supported a captive Sardaukar .
&quot; Here &apos;s one of them , m &apos;Lord , &quot; Gurney said .
He signed to the guard to hold the captive five paces in front of Paul .
The Sardaukar &apos;s eyes , Paul noted , carried a glazed expression of shock .
A blue <unk> stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth .
He was of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the look that seemed <unk> with rank among the Sardaukar , yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except the gold <unk> with the Imperial crest and the <unk> <unk> of his trousers .
&quot; I think this one &apos;s an officer , m &apos;Lord , &quot; Gurney said .
Paul nodded , said : &quot; I am the Duke Paul Atreides .
Do you understand that , man ? &quot;
The Sardaukar stared at him <unk> .
&quot; Speak up , &quot; Paul said , &quot; or your Emperor may die . &quot;
The man blinked , swallowed .
&quot; Who am I ? &quot;
Paul demanded .
&quot; You are the Duke Paul Atreides , &quot; the man husked .
He seemed too <unk> to Paul , but then the Sardaukar had never been prepared for such <unk> as this day .
They &apos;d never known anything but victory which , Paul realized , could be a weakness in itself .
He put that thought aside for later consideration in his own training program .
&quot; I have a message for you to carry to the Emperor , &quot; Paul said .
And he <unk> his words in the ancient <unk> : &quot; I , a Duke of a Great House , an Imperial <unk> , give my word of bond under the Convention .
If the Emperor and his people lay down their arms and come to me here I will guard their lives with my own . &quot;
Paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the Sardaukar to see .
&quot; I swear it by this . &quot;
The man wet his lips with his tongue , glanced at Gurney .
&quot; Yes , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Who but an Atreides could command the allegiance of Gurney Halleck . &quot;
&quot; I will carry the message , &quot; the Sardaukar said .
&quot; Take him to our forward command post and send him in , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Yes , m &apos;Lord . &quot;
Gurney motioned for the guard to obey , led them out .
Paul turned back to Stilgar .
&quot; Chani and your mother have arrived , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; Chani has asked time to be alone with her grief .
The Reverend Mother sought a moment in the weirding room ; I know not why . &quot;
&quot; My mother &apos;s sick with longing for a planet she may never see , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Where water falls from the sky and plants grow so <unk> you cannot walk between them . &quot;
&quot; Water from the sky , &quot; Stilgar whispered .
In that instant , Paul saw how Stilgar had been <unk> from the Fremen <unk> to a creature of the Lisan al-Gaib , a <unk> for awe and obedience .
It was a <unk> of the man , and Paul felt the <unk> of the jihad in it .
I have seen a friend become a <unk> , he thought .
In a <unk> of loneliness , Paul glanced around the room , noting how proper and <unk> his guards had become in his presence .
He sensed the subtle , <unk> <unk> among them -- each hoping for notice from Muad &apos;Dib .
Muad &apos;Dib from whom all <unk> flow , he thought , and it was the <unk> thought of his life .
They sense that I must take the throne , he thought .
But they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad .
Stilgar cleared his throat , said : &quot; Rabban , too , is dead . &quot;
Paul nodded .
Guards to the right suddenly snapped aside , standing at attention to open an <unk> for Jessica .
She wore her black aba and walked with a hint of striding across sand , but Paul noted how this house had restored to her something of what she had once been here -- concubine to a ruling duke .
Her presence carried some of its old <unk> .
Jessica stopped in front of Paul , looked down at him .
She saw his fatigue and how he hid it , but found no compassion for him .
It was as though she had been <unk> incapable of any emotion for her son .
Jessica had entered the Great Hall wondering why the place refused to fit itself <unk> in to her memories .
It remained a <unk> room , as though she had never walked here , never walked here with her beloved Leto , never confronted a <unk> Duncan Idaho here -- never , never , never .
.
.
There should be a <unk> directly opposite to <unk> , the demanding memory , she thought .
There should be a word for memories that deny themselves .
&quot; Where is Alia ? &quot;
she asked .
&quot; Out doing what any good Fremen child should be doing in such times , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; She &apos;s killing enemy wounded and marking their bodies for the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Paul ! &quot;
&quot; You must understand that she does this out of kindness , &quot; he said .
&quot; Isn &apos;t it odd how we <unk> the hidden <unk> of kindness and cruelty ? &quot;
Jessica glared at her son , shocked by the profound change in him .
Was it his child &apos;s death did this ?
she wondered .
And she said : &quot; The men tell strange stories of you , Paul .
They say you &apos;ve all the powers of the legend -- nothing can be hidden from you , that you see where others cannot see . &quot;
&quot; A Bene Gesserit should ask about legends ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; I &apos;ve had a hand in whatever you are , &quot; she admitted , &quot; but you mustn &apos;t expect me to -- &quot; &quot; How would you like to live billions upon billions of lives ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; There &apos;s a fabric of legends for you !
Think of all those experiences , the wisdom they &apos;d bring .
But wisdom <unk> love , doesn &apos;t it ?
And it puts a new shape on hate .
How can you tell what &apos;s ruthless unless you &apos;ve <unk> the depths of both cruelty and kindness ?
You should fear me , Mother .
I am the Kwisatz Haderach . &quot;
Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat .
Presently , she said ; &quot; Once you denied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach . &quot;
Paul shook his head .
&quot; I can deny nothing any more . &quot;
He looked up into her eyes .
&quot; The Emperor and his people come now .
They will be <unk> any moment .
Stand beside me .
I wish a clear view of them .
My future <unk> will be among them . &quot;
&quot; Paul ! &quot;
Jessica snapped .
&quot; Don &apos;t make the mistake your father made ! &quot;
&quot; She &apos;s a princess , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; She &apos;s my key to the throne , and that &apos;s all she &apos;ll ever be .
<unk> ?
You think because I &apos;m what you made me that I cannot feel the need for revenge ? &quot;
&quot; Even on the innocent ? &quot;
she asked , and she thought : He must not make the mistakes I made .
&quot; There are no innocent any more , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Tell that to Chani , &quot; Jessica said , and gestured toward the passage from the rear of the Residency .
Chani entered the Great Hall there , walking between the Fremen guards as though <unk> of them .
Her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back , face mask fastened aside .
She walked with a <unk> uncertainty as she crossed the room to stand beside Jessica .
Paul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks -- She gives water to the dead .
He felt a pang of grief strike through him , but it was as though he could only feel this thing through Chani &apos;s presence .
&quot; He is dead , beloved , &quot; Chani said .
&quot; Our son is dead . &quot;
<unk> himself under stiff control , Paul got to his feet .
He reached out , touched Chani &apos;s cheek , feeling the dampness of her tears .
&quot; He cannot be replaced , &quot; Paul said , &quot; but there will be other sons .
It is Usul who promises this . &quot;
Gently , he moved her aside , gestured to Stilgar .
&quot; Muad &apos;Dib , &quot; Stilgar said .
&quot; They come from the ship , the Emperor and his people , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; I will stand here .
<unk> the <unk> in an open space in , the center of the room .
They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless I command otherwise . &quot;
&quot; As you command , Muad &apos;Dib . &quot;
As Stilgar turned to obey , Paul heard the awed muttering of Fremen guards : &quot; You see ?
He knew !
No one told him , but he knew ! &quot;
The Emperor &apos;s entourage could be heard approaching now , his Sardaukar humming one of their <unk> <unk> to keep up their spirits .
There came a <unk> of voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck passed through the guard , crossed to <unk> with Stilgar , then moved to Paul &apos;s side , a strange look in His eyes .
Will I lose Gurney , too ?
Paul wondered .
The way I lost Stilgar -- losing a friend to gain a creature ?
&quot; They have no throwing weapons , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; I &apos;ve made sure of that myself . &quot;
He glanced around the room , seeing Paul &apos;s preparations .
&quot; Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is with them .
Shall I cut him out ? &quot;
&quot; Leave him . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;re some Guild people , too , demanding special privileges , <unk> an <unk> against Arrakis .
I told them I &apos;d give you their message . &quot;
&quot; Let them threaten . &quot;
&quot; Paul ! &quot;
Jessica hissed behind him .
&quot; He &apos;s talking about the Guild ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll pull their <unk> presently , &quot; Paul said .
And he thought then about the Guild -- the force that had <unk> for so long that it had become a <unk> , unable to exist <unk> of the life upon which it fed .
They had never dared grasp the sword .
.
.
and now they could not grasp it .
They might have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of <unk> on the melange <unk> narcotic for their navigators .
They could have done this , lived their <unk> day and died .
Instead , they &apos;d existed from moment to moment , hoping the seas in which they <unk> might produce a new host when the old one died .
The Guild navigators , gifted with limited prescience , had made the fatal decision : they &apos;d chosen always the clear , safe course that leads ever downward into stagnation .
Let them look closely at their new host , Paul thought .
&quot; There &apos;s also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she &apos;s a friend of your mother , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends . &quot;
Again , Gurney glanced around the Great Hall , then bent close to Paul &apos;s ear .
&quot; Thufir Hawat &apos;s with &apos; em , m &apos;Lord .
I had no chance to see him alone , but he used our old hand signs to say he &apos;s been working with the Harkonnens , thought you were dead .
<unk> he &apos;s to be left among &apos; em . &quot;
&quot; You left Thufir among those -- &quot; &quot; He wanted it .
.
.
and I thought it best .
If .
.
.
there &apos;s something wrong , he &apos;s where we can control him .
If not -- we &apos;ve an ear on the other side . &quot;
Paul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this moment -- and one <unk> where Thufir carried a poisoned needle which the Emperor commanded he use against &quot; this <unk> Duke . &quot;
The entrance guards stepped aside , formed a short corridor of <unk> .
There came a murmurous swish of garments , feet <unk> the sand that had drifted into the Residency .
The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall .
His <unk> <unk> had been lost and the red hair stood out in <unk> .
His uniform &apos;s left sleeve had been ripped along the inner <unk> .
He was <unk> and without weapons , but his presence moved with him like a <unk> bubble that kept his immediate area open .
A Fremen lance dropped across his path , stopped him where Paul had ordered .
The others <unk> up behind , a <unk> of color , of <unk> and of staring faces .
Paul swept his gaze across the group , saw women who hid signs of <unk> , saw the lackeys who had come to enjoy <unk> seats at a Sardaukar victory and now stood <unk> to silence by defeat .
Paul saw the bird-bright eyes of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring beneath her black hood , and beside her the narrow <unk> of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen .
There &apos;s a face time betrayed to me , Paul thought .
He looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then , <unk> by a movement , seeing there a narrow , <unk> face he &apos;d never before encountered -- not in time or out of it .
It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a marker of fear .
Why should I fear that man ?
he wondered .
He leaned toward his mother , whispered : &quot; That man to the left of the Reverend Mother , the <unk> one -- who is that ? &quot;
Jessica looked , recognizing the face from her Duke &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; Count Fenring , &quot; she said .
&quot; The one who was here immediately before us .
A <unk> .
.
.
and a killer . &quot;
The Emperor &apos;s errand boy , Paul thought .
And the thought was a shock <unk> across his consciousness because he had seen the Emperor in <unk> <unk> spread through the possible <unk> never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions .
It occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along countless reaches of the time <unk> , but never once had he seen his moment of death .
Have I been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills me ?
Paul wondered .
The thought sent a pang of foreboding through him .
He forced his attention away from Fenring , looked now at the remnants of Sardaukar men and officers , the bitterness on their faces and the desperation .
Here and there among them , faces caught Paul &apos;s attention briefly : Sardaukar officers measuring the preparations within this room , <unk> and scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into victory .
Paul &apos;s attention came at last to a tall <unk> woman , <unk> , a face of <unk> beauty , <unk> in its <unk> , untouched by tears , completely <unk> .
Without being told it , Paul knew her -- Princess Royal , Bene Gesserit -- trained , a face that time vision had shown him in many <unk> : Irulan .
There &apos;s my key , he thought .
Then he saw movement in the <unk> people , a face and figure emerged -- Thufir Hawat , the seamed old features with darkly stained lips , the <unk> shoulders , the look of <unk> age about him .
&quot; There &apos;s Thufir Hawat , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Let him stand free , Gurney . &quot;
&quot; M &apos;Lord , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; Let him stand free , &quot; Paul repeated .
Gurney nodded .
Hawat <unk> forward as a Fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind him .
The rheumy eyes peered at Paul , measuring , seeking .
Paul stepped forward one pace , sensed the tense , waiting movement of the Emperor and his people .
Hawat &apos;s gaze stabbed past Paul , and the old man said : &quot; Lady Jessica , I but learned this day how I &apos;ve <unk> you in my thoughts .
You <unk> &apos;t forgive . &quot;
Paul waited , but his mother remained silent .
&quot; Thufir , old friend , &quot; Paul said , &quot; as you can see , my back is toward no door . &quot;
&quot; The universe is full of doors , &quot; Hawat said .
&quot; <unk> I my father &apos;s son ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; More like your grandfather &apos;s , &quot; Hawat rasped .
&quot; You &apos;ve his manner and the look of him in your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Yet I &apos;m my father &apos;s son , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; For I say to you , Thufir , that in <unk> for your years of service to my family you may now ask anything you wish of me .
Anything at all .
Do you need my life now , Thufir ?
It is yours . &quot;
Paul stepped forward a pace , hands at his side , seeing the look of awareness grow in Hawat &apos;s eyes .
He <unk> that I know of the treachery , Paul thought .
<unk> his voice to carry in a <unk> for Hawat &apos;s ears alone , Paul said : &quot; I mean this , Thufir .
If you &apos;re to strike me , do it now . &quot;
&quot; I but wanted to stand before you once more , my Duke , &quot; Hawat said .
And Paul became aware for the first time of the effort the old man <unk> to keep from falling .
Paul reached out , supported Hawat by the shoulders , feeling the muscle <unk> beneath his hands .
&quot; Is there pain , old friend ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; There is pain , my Duke , &quot; Hawat agreed , &quot; but the pleasure is greater . &quot;
He half turned in Paul &apos;s arms , extended his left hand , palm up , toward the Emperor , exposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers .
&quot; See , Majesty ? &quot;
he called .
&quot; See your traitor &apos;s needle ?
Did you think that I who &apos;ve given my life to service of the Atreides would give them less now ? &quot;
Paul staggered as the old man sagged in his arms , felt the death there , the utter <unk> .
Gently , Paul lowered Hawat to the floor , straightened and signed for guardsmen to carry the body away .
Silence held the hall while his command was obeyed .
A look of deadly waiting held the Emperor &apos;s face now .
Eyes that had never admitted fear admitted it at last .
&quot; Majesty , &quot; Paul said , and noted the <unk> of surprised attention in the tall Princess Royal .
The words had been uttered with the Bene Gesserit controlled <unk> , carrying in it every shade of <unk> and scorn that Paul could put there .
<unk> trained indeed , Paul thought .
The Emperor cleared his throat , said : &quot; Perhaps my <unk> <unk> believes he has things all his own way now .
Nothing could be more remote from fact .
You have <unk> the Convention , used atomics against -- &quot; &quot; I used atomics against a natural feature of the desert , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; It was in my way and I was in a hurry to get to you , Majesty , to ask your explanation for some of your strange <unk> . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s a massed <unk> of the Great Houses in space over Arrakis right now , &quot; the Emperor said .
&quot; I &apos;ve but to say the word and they &apos;ll -- &quot; &quot; Oh , yes , &quot; Paul said , &quot; I almost forgot about them . &quot;
He searched through the Emperor &apos;s suite until he saw the faces of the two Guildsmen , spoke aside to Gurney .
&quot; Are those the Guild agents , Gurney , the two fat ones dressed in gray over there ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , m &apos;Lord . &quot;
&quot; You two , &quot; Paul said , pointing .
&quot; Get out of there immediately and dispatch messages that will get that <unk> on its way home .
After this , you &apos;ll ask my permission before -- &quot; &quot; The Guild doesn &apos;t take your orders ! &quot;
the taller of the two barked .
He and his companion pushed through to the barrier <unk> , which were raised at a nod from Paul .
The two men stepped out and the taller leveled an arm at Paul , said : &quot; You may very well be under <unk> for your -- &quot; &quot; If I hear any more nonsense from either of you , &quot; Paul said , &quot; I &apos;ll give the order that &apos;ll destroy all spice production on Arrakis .
.
.
forever . &quot;
&quot; Are you mad ? &quot;
the tall Guildsman demanded .
He fell back half a step .
&quot; You grant that I have the power to do this thing , then ? &quot;
Paul asked .
The Guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment , then : &quot; Yes , you could do it , but you must not . &quot;
&quot; Ah-h-h , &quot; Paul said and nodded to himself .
&quot; Guild navigators , both of you , eh ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ! &quot;
The <unk> of the pair said : &quot; You would blind yourself , too , and <unk> us all to slow death .
Have you any idea what it means to be <unk> of the spice liquor once you &apos;re addicted ? &quot;
&quot; The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; The Guild is <unk> .
Humans become little <unk> <unk> on their <unk> planets .
You know , I might do this thing out of pure spite .
.
.
or out of <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Let us talk this over privately , &quot; the taller Guildsman said .
&quot; I &apos;m sure we can come to some <unk> that is -- &quot; &quot; Send the message to your people over Arrakis , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; I grow tired of this argument .
If that <unk> over us doesn &apos;t leave soon there &apos;ll be no need for us to talk . &quot;
He nodded toward his communications men at the side of the hall .
&quot; You may use our equipment . &quot;
&quot; First we must discuss this , &quot; the tall Guildsman said .
&quot; We cannot just -- &quot; &quot; Do it ! &quot;
Paul barked .
&quot; The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it .
You &apos;ve agreed I have that power .
We are not here to discuss or to negotiate or to <unk> .
You will obey my orders or suffer the immediate consequences ! &quot;
&quot; He means it , &quot; the <unk> Guildsman said .
And Paul saw the fear grip them .
Slowly the two crossed to the Fremen communications equipment .
&quot; Will they obey ? &quot;
Gurney asked .
&quot; They have a narrow vision of time , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; They can see ahead to a blank wall marking the consequences of <unk> .
Every Guild <unk> on every ship over us can look ahead to that same wall .
They &apos;ll obey . &quot;
Paul turned back to look at the Emperor , said : &quot; When they permitted you to mount your father &apos;s throne , it was only on the assurance that you &apos;d keep the spice flowing .
You &apos;ve failed them , Majesty .
Do you know the consequences ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> permitted me to -- &quot; &quot; Stop playing the fool , &quot; Paul barked .
&quot; The Guild is like a village beside a river .
They need the water , but can only dip out what they require .
They cannot <unk> the river and control it , because that <unk> attention on what they take , it brings down <unk> destruction .
The spice flow , that &apos;s their river , and I have built a <unk> .
But my <unk> is such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river . &quot;
The Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair , glanced at the backs of the two Guildsmen .
&quot; Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; There are other poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks , but once they &apos;ve used the spice liquor , the others no longer work . &quot;
The old woman pulled her <unk> black robes around her , pressed forward out of the crowd to stand at the barrier <unk> .
&quot; Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; It has been a long time since Caladan , hasn &apos;t it ? &quot;
She looked past him at his mother , said : &quot; Well , Jessica , I see that your son is indeed the one .
For that you can be <unk> even the abomination of your daughter . &quot;
Paul stilled a cold , <unk> anger , said : &quot; You &apos;ve never had the right or cause to forgive my mother anything ! &quot;
The old woman locked eyes with him .
&quot; Try your tricks on me , old witch , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Where &apos;s your gom jabbar ?
Try looking into that place where you dare not look !
You &apos;ll find me there staring out at you ! &quot;
The old woman dropped her gaze .
&quot; Have you nothing to say ? &quot;
Paul demanded .
&quot; I <unk> you to the ranks of humans , &quot; she muttered .
&quot; Don &apos;t <unk> that . &quot;
Paul raised his voice : &quot; Observe her , <unk> !
This is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother , <unk> in a <unk> cause .
She could wait with her sisters -- <unk> generations for the proper combination of <unk> and environment to produce the one person their schemes required .
Observe her !
She knows now that the <unk> generations have produced that person .
Here I stand .
.
.
but .
.
.
I .
.
.
will .
.
.
never .
.
.
do .
.
.
her .
.
.
bidding ! &quot;
&quot; Jessica ! &quot;
the old woman screamed .
&quot; Silence him ! &quot;
&quot; Silence him yourself , &quot; Jessica said .
Paul glared at the old woman .
&quot; For your part in all this I could <unk> have you strangled , &quot; he said .
&quot; You couldn &apos;t prevent it ! &quot;
he snapped as she stiffened in rage .
&quot; But I think it better punishment that you live out your years never able to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires . &quot;
&quot; Jessica , what have you done ? &quot;
the old woman demanded .
&quot; I &apos;ll give you only one thing , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; You saw part of what the race needs , but how <unk> you saw it .
You think to control human breeding and <unk> a <unk> few according to your master plan !
How little you understand of what -- &quot; &quot; You mustn &apos;t speak of these things ! &quot;
the old woman hissed .
&quot; Silence ! &quot;
Paul roared .
The word seemed to take substance as it twisted through the air between them under Paul &apos;s control .
The old woman <unk> back into the arms of those behind her , face blank with shock at the power with which he had <unk> her <unk> .
&quot; Jessica , &quot; she whispered .
&quot; Jessica . &quot;
&quot; I remember your gom jabbar , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; You remember mine .
I can kill you with a word . &quot;
The Fremen around the ball glanced <unk> at each other .
Did the legend not say : &quot; And his word shall carry death <unk> to those who stand against <unk> . &quot;
Paul turned his attention to the tall Princess Royal standing beside her Emperor father .
<unk> his eyes focused on her , he said : &quot; Majesty , we both know the way out of our difficulty . &quot;
The Emperor glanced at his daughter , back to Paul .
&quot; You dare ?
You !
An <unk> without family , a <unk> from -- &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve already admitted who I am , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Royal <unk> , you said .
Let &apos;s stop this nonsense . &quot;
&quot; I am your ruler , &quot; the Emperor said .
Paul glanced at the Guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment and facing him .
One of them nodded .
&quot; I could force it , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; You will not dare ! &quot;
the Emperor grated .
Paul merely stared at him .
The Princess Royal put a hand on her father &apos;s arm .
&quot; Father , &quot; she said , and her voice was <unk> soft , soothing .
&quot; Don &apos;t try your tricks on me , &quot; the Emperor said .
He looked at her .
&quot; You don &apos;t need to do this , <unk> .
We &apos;ve other resources that -- &quot; &quot; But here &apos;s a man fit to be your son , &quot; she said .
The old Reverend Mother , her <unk> <unk> , forced her way to the Emperor &apos;s side , leaned close to his ear and whispered .
&quot; She <unk> your case , &quot; Jessica said .
Paul continued to look at the <unk> Princess .
<unk> to his mother , he said : &quot; That &apos;s Irulan , the <unk> , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
Chani moved up on Paul &apos;s other side , said : &quot; Do you wish me to leave , Muad &apos;Dib ? &quot;
He glanced at her .
&quot; Leave ?
You &apos;ll never again leave my side . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s nothing binding between us , &quot; Chani said .
Paul looked down at her for a silent moment , then : &quot; Speak only truth with me , my Sihaya . &quot;
As she started to reply , he <unk> her with a finger to her lips .
&quot; That which <unk> us cannot be <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; Now , watch these matters closely for I wish to see this room later through your wisdom . &quot;
The Emperor and his Truthsayer were carrying on a <unk> , low-voiced argument .
Paul spoke to his mother : &quot; She <unk> him that it &apos;s part of their agreement to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne , and Irulan is the one they &apos;ve <unk> for it . &quot;
&quot; Was that their plan ? &quot;
Jessica said .
&quot; Isn &apos;t it obvious ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; I see the signs ! &quot;
Jessica snapped .
&quot; My question was meant to remind you that you should not try to teach me those matters in which I instructed you . &quot;
Paul glanced at her , caught a cold smile on her lips .
Gurney Halleck leaned between them , said : &quot; I remind you , m &apos;Lord , that there &apos;s a Harkonnen in that bunch . &quot;
He nodded toward the dark-haired Feyd-Rautha pressed against a barrier lance on the left .
&quot; The one with the <unk> eyes there on the left .
As evil a face as I ever say .
You promised me once that -- &quot; &quot; Thank you , Gurney , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; It &apos;s the na-Baron .
.
.
Baron now that the old man &apos;s dead , &quot; Gurney said .
&quot; He &apos;ll do for what I &apos;ve in -- &quot; &quot; Can you take him , Gurney ? &quot;
&quot; M &apos;Lord <unk> ! &quot;
&quot; That argument between the Emperor and his witch has gone on long enough , don &apos;t you think , Mother ? &quot;
She nodded .
&quot; Indeed . &quot;
Paul raised his voice , called out to the Emperor : &quot; Majesty , is there a Harkonnen among you ? &quot;
Royal disdain revealed itself in the way the Emperor turned to look at Paul .
&quot; I believe my entourage has been placed under the protection of your ducal word , &quot; he said .
&quot; My question was for information only , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; I wish to know if a Harkonnen is <unk> a part of your entourage or if a Harkonnen is merely hiding behind a <unk> out of cowardice . &quot;
The Emperor &apos;s smile was <unk> .
&quot; Anyone accepted into the Imperial company is a member of my entourage . &quot;
&quot; You have the word of a Duke , &quot; Paul said , &quot; but Muad &apos;Dib is another matter .
He may not recognize your <unk> of what <unk> an entourage .
My friend Gurney Halleck wishes to kill a Harkonnen .
If he -- &quot; &quot; Kanly ! &quot;
Feyd-Rautha shouted .
He pressed against the barrier lance .
&quot; Your father named this vendetta , Atreides .
You call me <unk> while you hide among your women and offer to send a <unk> against me ! &quot;
The old Truthsayer whispered something <unk> into the Emperor &apos;s ear , but he pushed her aside , said : &quot; Kanly , is it ?
There are <unk> rules for kanly . &quot;
&quot; Paul , put a stop to this , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; M &apos;Lord , &quot; Gurney said , &quot; You promised me my day against the Harkonnens . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve had your day against them , &quot; Paul said and he felt a <unk> abandon take over his emotions .
He slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders , handed them to his mother with his belt and crysknife , began <unk> his stillsuit .
He sensed now that the universe focused on this moment .
&quot; There &apos;s no need for this , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; There are easier ways , Paul . &quot;
Paul stepped out of his stillsuit , slipped the crysknife from its sheath in his mother &apos;s hand .
&quot; I know , &quot; he said .
&quot; Poison , an assassin , all the old familiar ways . &quot;
&quot; You promised me a Harkonnen ! &quot;
Gurney hissed , and Paul marked the rage in the man &apos;s face , the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and <unk> .
&quot; You owe it to me , m &apos;Lord ! &quot;
&quot; Have you suffered more from them than I ? &quot;
Paul asked .
&quot; My sister , &quot; Gurney rasped .
&quot; My years in the slave pits -- &quot; &quot; My father , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; My good friends and companions , Thufir Hawat and Duncan Idaho , my years as a fugitive without rank or <unk> .
.
.
and one more thing : it is now kanly and you know as well as I the rules that must <unk> . &quot;
Halleck &apos;s shoulders sagged .
&quot; M &apos;Lord , if that <unk> .
.
.
he &apos;s no more than a beast you &apos;d <unk> with your foot and discard the <unk> because it &apos;d been <unk> .
Call in an executioner , if you must , or let me do it , but don &apos;t offer yourself to -- &quot; &quot; Muad &apos;Dib need not do this thing , &quot; Chani said .
He glanced at her , saw the fear for him in her eyes .
&quot; But the Duke Paul must , &quot; he said .
&quot; This is a Harkonnen animal ! &quot;
Gurney rasped .
Paul hesitated on the point of revealing his own Harkonnen ancestry , stopped at a sharp look from his mother , said merely : &quot; But this being has human shape , Gurney , and deserves human doubt . &quot;
Gurney said : &quot; If he so much as -- &quot; &quot; Please stand aside , &quot; Paul said .
He hefted the crysknife , pushed Gurney gently aside .
&quot; Gurney ! &quot;
Jessica said .
She touched Gurney &apos;s arm .
&quot; He &apos;s like his grandfather in this mood .
Don &apos;t distract him .
It &apos;s the only thing you can do for him now . &quot;
And she thought : Great Mother !
What irony .
The Emperor was studying Feyd-Rautha , seeing the heavy shoulders , the thick muscles .
He turned to look at Paul -- a stringy <unk> of a youth , not as <unk> as the Arrakeen natives , but with <unk> there to count , and <unk> in the <unk> so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the skin .
Jessica leaned close to Paul , pitched her voice for his ears alone : &quot; One thing , Son .
Sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the Bene Gesserit , a word <unk> into the deepest <unk> by the old <unk> methods .
The <unk> most frequently used is <unk> .
If this one &apos;s been prepared , as I <unk> suspect , that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles <unk> and -- &quot; &quot; I want no special advantage for this one , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Step back out of my way . &quot;
Gurney spoke to her : &quot; Why is he doing this ?
Does he think to get himself killed and <unk> <unk> ?
This Fremen religious prattle , is that what clouds his reason ? &quot;
Jessica hid her face in her hands , realizing that she did not know fully why Paul took this course .
She could feel death in the room and knew that the changed Paul was capable of such a thing as Gurney suggested .
Every <unk> within her focused on the need to protect her son , but there was nothing she could do .
&quot; Is it this religious prattle ? &quot;
Gurney <unk> .
&quot; Be silent , &quot; Jessica whispered .
&quot; And pray . &quot;
The Emperor &apos;s face was touched by an abrupt smile .
&quot; If Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen .
.
.
of my entourage .
.
.
so wishes , &quot; he said , &quot; I <unk> him of all <unk> and give him freedom to choose his own course in this . &quot;
The Emperor waved a hand toward Paul &apos;s Fedaykin guards .
&quot; One of your rabble has my belt and short blade .
If Feyd-Rautha wishes it , he may meet you with my blade in his hand . &quot;
&quot; I wish it , &quot; Feyd-Rautha said , and Paul saw the elation on the man &apos;s face .
He &apos;s <unk> , Paul thought .
There &apos;s a natural advantage I can accept .
&quot; Get the Emperor &apos;s blade , &quot; Paul said , and watched as his command was obeyed .
&quot; Put it on the floor there . &quot;
He indicated a place with his foot .
&quot; <unk> the Imperial rabble back against the wall and let the Harkonnen stand clear . &quot;
A <unk> of robes , scraping of feet , low-voiced commands and <unk> accompanied obedience to Paul &apos;s command .
The Guildsmen remained standing near the communications equipment .
They frowned at Paul in obvious <unk> .
They &apos;re accustomed to seeing the future , Paul thought .
In this place and time they &apos;re blind .
.
.
even as I am .
And he <unk> the <unk> , sensing the turmoil , the storm nexus that now focused on this moment place .
Even the faint <unk> were closed now .
Here was the unborn jihad , he knew .
Here was the race consciousness that he had known once as his own terrible purpose .
Here was reason enough for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Lisan al-Gaib or even the <unk> schemes of the Bene Gesserit .
The race of humans had felt its own <unk> , sensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in which the <unk> would mingle and the strong new <unk> survive .
All humans were alive as an unconscious single organism in this moment , experiencing a kind of <unk> heat that could override any barrier .
And Paul saw how <unk> were any <unk> of his to change any smallest bit of this .
He had thought to <unk> the jihad within himself , but the jihad would be .
His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without him .
They needed only the legend he already had become .
He had shown them the way , given them <unk> even over the Guild which must have the spice to exist .
A sense of failure <unk> him , and he saw through it that Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen had slipped out of the torn uniform , <unk> down to a fighting girdle with a <unk> core .
This is the <unk> , Paul thought .
From here , the future will open , the clouds part onto a kind of glory .
And if I die here , they &apos;ll say I sacrificed myself that my spirit might lead them .
And if I live , they &apos;ll say nothing can <unk> Muad &apos;Dib .
&quot; Is the Atreides ready ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha called , using the words of the ancient kanly ritual .
Paul chose to answer him in the Fremen way : &quot; May thy knife chip and shatter ! &quot;
He pointed to the Emperor &apos;s blade on the floor , <unk> that Feyd-Rautha should advance and take it .
<unk> his attention on Paul , Feyd-Rautha picked up the knife , <unk> it a moment in his hand to get the feel of it .
<unk> <unk> in him .
This was a fight he had dreamed about -- man against man , <unk> against <unk> with no shields <unk> .
He could see a way to power opening before him because the Emperor surely would reward whoever killed this <unk> duke .
The reward might even be that <unk> daughter and a share of the throne .
And this <unk> duke , this <unk> <unk> could not possibly be a match for a Harkonnen trained in every device and every treachery by a thousand arena <unk> .
And the <unk> had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here .
Let us see if you &apos;re proof against poison !
Feyd-Rautha thought .
He saluted Paul with the Emperor &apos;s blade , said : &quot; <unk> your death , fool . &quot;
&quot; Shall we fight , cousin ? &quot;
Paul asked .
And he <unk> forward , eyes on the waiting blade , his body crouched low with his own <unk> crysknife pointing out as though an extension of his arm .
They circled each other , bare feet grating on the floor , watching with eyes intent for the slightest opening .
&quot; How beautifully you dance , &quot; Feyd-Rautha said .
He &apos;s a <unk> , Paul thought .
There &apos;s another weakness .
He grows uneasy in the face of silence .
&quot; Have you been <unk> ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha asked .
Still , Paul circled in silence .
And the old Reverend Mother , watching the fight from the press of the Emperor &apos;s suite , felt herself trembling .
The Atreides youth had called the Harkonnen cousin .
It could only mean he knew the ancestry they shared , easy to understand because he was the Kwisatz Haderach .
But the words forced her to focus on the only thing that <unk> to her here .
This could be a major <unk> for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme .
She had seen something of what Paul had seen here , that Feyd-Rautha might kill but not be <unk> .
Another thought , though , almost overwhelmed her .
Two end <unk> of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the death that might easily claim both of them .
If both died here that would leave only Feyd-Rautha &apos;s <unk> daughter , still a baby , an unknown , an <unk> factor , and Alia , the abomination .
&quot; Perhaps you have only <unk> rites here , &quot; Feyd-Rautha said .
&quot; Would you like the Emperor &apos;s Truthsayer to prepare your spirit for its journey ? &quot;
Paul smiled , circling to the right , alert , his black thoughts suppressed by the needs of the moment .
Feyd-Rautha leaped , <unk> with right hand , but with the knife shifted in a blur to his left hand .
Paul dodged easily , noting the <unk> hesitation in Feyd-Rautha &apos;s thrust .
Still , it was not as great a shield conditioning as some Paul had seen , and he sensed that Feyd-Rautha had fought before against unshielded <unk> .
&quot; Does an Atreides run or stand and fight ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha asked .
Paul resumed his silent circling .
Idaho &apos;s words came back to him , the words of training from the <unk> practice floor on Caladan : &quot; Use the first moments in study .
You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way , but the moments of study are <unk> of <unk> .
Take your time and be sure . &quot;
&quot; Perhaps you think this dance <unk> your life a few moments , &quot; Feyd-Rautha said .
&quot; Well and good . &quot;
He stopped the circling , straightened .
Paul had seen enough for a first approximation .
Feyd-Rautha led to the left side , <unk> the right hip as though the <unk> fighting girdle could protect his entire side .
It was the action of a man trained to the shield and with a knife in both hands .
Or .
.
.
And Paul hesitated .
.
.
the girdle was more than it seemed .
The Harkonnen appeared too confident against a man who &apos;d this day led the forces of victory against Sardaukar legions .
Feyd-Rautha noted the hesitation , said : &quot; Why <unk> the <unk> ?
You but keep me from <unk> my rights over this ball of dirt . &quot;
If it &apos;s a <unk> , Paul thought , it &apos;s a cunning one .
The girdle <unk> no signs of <unk> .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you speak ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha demanded .
Paul resumed his probing circle , allowing himself a cold smile at the tone of unease in Feyd-Rautha &apos;s voice , evidence that the pressure of silence was building .
&quot; You smile , eh ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha asked .
And he leaped in <unk> .
<unk> the slight hesitation , Paul almost failed to evade the <unk> of blade , felt its tip scratch his left arm .
He <unk> the sudden pain there , his mind flooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick -- an <unk> .
Here was more of an opponent than he had expected .
There would be tricks within tricks within tricks .
&quot; Your own Thufir Hawat taught me some of my <unk> , &quot; Feyd-Rautha said .
&quot; He gave me first blood .
Too bad the old fool didn &apos;t live to see it . &quot;
And Paul recalled that Idaho had once said , &quot; <unk> only what happens in the fight .
That way you &apos;ll never be surprised . &quot;
Again the two circled each other , crouched , cautious .
Paul saw the return of elation to his opponent , wondered at it .
Did a scratch <unk> that much to the man ?
Unless there were poison on the blade !
But how could there be ?
His own men had handled the weapon , <unk> it before passing it .
They were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that .
&quot; That woman you were talking to over there , &quot; Feyd-Rautha said .
&quot; The little one .
Is she something special to you ?
A <unk> perhaps ?
Will she deserve my special <unk> ? &quot;
Paul remained silent , probing with his inner senses , <unk> the blood from the wound , finding a trace of soporific from the Emperor &apos;s blade .
He <unk> his own <unk> to match this threat and change the <unk> of the soporific , but he felt a <unk> of doubt .
They &apos;d been prepared with soporific on a blade .
A soporific .
Nothing to alert a poison snooper , but strong enough to slow the muscles it touched .
His enemies had their own plans within plans , their own stacked <unk> .
Again Feyd-Rautha leaped , <unk> .
Paul , the smile frozen on his face , feinted with slowness as though inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the <unk> arm on the crysknife &apos;s point .
Feyd-Rautha <unk> sideways and was out and away , his blade shifted to his left hand , and the measure of him that only a slight <unk> of jaw betrayed the acid pain where Paul had cut him .
Let him know his own moment of doubt , Paul thought .
Let him suspect poison .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
Feyd-Rautha shouted .
&quot; He &apos;s poisoned me !
I do feel poison in my arm ! &quot;
Paul dropped his cloak of silence , said : &quot; Only a little acid to counter the soporific on the Emperor &apos;s blade . &quot;
Feyd-Rautha matched Paul &apos;s cold smile , lifted blade in left hand for a mock salute .
His eyes glared rage behind the knife .
Paul shifted his crysknife to his left hand , <unk> his opponent .
Again , they circled , probing .
Feyd-Rautha began <unk> the space between them , <unk> in , knife held high , anger showing itself in <unk> of eye and set of jaw .
He feinted right and under , and they were pressed against each other , knife hands gripped , <unk> .
Paul , cautious of Feyd-Rautha &apos;s right hip where he suspected a poison <unk> , forced the turn to the right .
He almost failed to see the <unk> <unk> out beneath the belt line .
A shift and a giving in Feyd-Rautha &apos;s motion warned him .
The tiny point missed Paul &apos;s flesh by the <unk> <unk> .
On the left hip !
<unk> within treachery within treachery , Paul reminded himself .
Using Bene <unk> muscles , he sagged to catch a reflex in Feyd-Rautha , but the necessity of avoiding the tiny point <unk> from his opponent &apos;s hip threw Paul off just enough that he missed his <unk> and found himself thrown hard to the floor , Feyd-Rautha on top .
&quot; You see it there on my hip ? &quot;
Feyd-Rautha whispered .
&quot; Your death , fool . &quot;
And he began twisting himself around , forcing the poisoned needle closer and closer .
&quot; It &apos;ll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you .
There &apos;ll be never a trace left to detect ! &quot;
Paul <unk> , hearing the silent <unk> in his mind , his <unk> ancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha , to save himself .
&quot; I will not say it ! &quot;
Paul gasped .
Feyd-Rautha <unk> at him , caught in the <unk> <unk> of hesitation .
It was enough for Paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his opponent &apos;s leg muscles , and their positions were <unk> .
Feyd-Rautha lay partly underneath with right hip high , unable to turn because of the tiny <unk> caught against the floor beneath him .
Paul twisted his left hand free , <unk> by the <unk> of blood from his arm , thrust once hard up underneath Feyd-Rautha &apos;s jaw .
The point slid home into the <unk> .
Feyd-Rautha jerked and sagged back , still held partly on his side by the needle <unk> in the floor .
<unk> deeply to restore his calm , Paul pushed himself away and got to his feet .
He stood over the body , knife in hand , raised his eyes with deliberate slowness to look across the room at the Emperor .
&quot; Majesty , &quot; Paul said , &quot; your force is reduced by one more .
Shall we now <unk> sham and pretense ?
Shall we now discuss what must be ?
Your daughter wed to me and the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne . &quot;
The Emperor turned , looked at Count Fenring .
The Count met his stare -- gray eyes against green .
The thought lay there clearly between them , their association so long that understanding could be achieved with a glance .
Kill this <unk> for me , the Emperor was saying .
The Atreides is young and <unk> , yes -- but he is also tired from long effort and he &apos;d be no match for you , anyway .
Call him out now .
.
.
you know the way of it .
Kill him .
Slowly , Fenring moved his head , a <unk> turning until he faced Paul .
&quot; Do it ! &quot;
the Emperor hissed .
The Count focused on Paul , seeing with eyes his Lady <unk> had trained in the Bene Gesserit way , aware of the mystery and hidden <unk> about this Atreides youth .
I could kill him , Fenring thought -- and he knew this for a truth .
Something in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then , and he glimpsed briefly , <unk> , the advantage he held over Paul -- a way of hiding from the youth , a <unk> of person and motives that no eye could penetrate .
Paul , aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled , understood at last why he had never seen Fenring along the <unk> of prescience .
Fenring was one of the <unk> , an almost Kwisatz Haderach , <unk> by a <unk> in the genetic pattern -- a <unk> , his <unk> concentrated into <unk> and inner <unk> .
A deep compassion for the Count flowed through Paul , the first sense of brotherhood he &apos;d ever experienced .
Fenring , reading Paul &apos;s emotion , said , &quot; Majesty , I must refuse . &quot;
<unk> overcame Shaddam IV .
He took two short steps through the entourage , <unk> Fenring <unk> across the jaw .
A dark flush spread up and over the Count &apos;s face .
He looked directly at the Emperor , spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis : &quot; We have been friends , Majesty .
What I do now is out of friendship .
I shall forget that you struck me . &quot;
Paul cleared his throat , said : &quot; We were speaking of the throne , Majesty . &quot;
The Emperor whirled , glared at Paul .
&quot; I sit on the throne ! &quot;
he barked .
&quot; You shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; I put down my arms and came here on your word of bond ! &quot;
the Emperor shouted .
&quot; You dare threaten -- &quot; &quot; Your person is safe in my presence , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; An Atreides promised it .
Muad &apos;Dib , however , <unk> you to your prison planet .
But have no fear , Majesty .
I will ease the harshness of the place with all the powers at my <unk> .
It shall become a garden world , full of gentle things . &quot;
As the hidden import of Paul &apos;s words grew in the Emperor &apos;s mind , he glared across the room at Paul .
&quot; Now we see true motives , &quot; he sneered .
&quot; Indeed , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; And what of Arrakis ? &quot;
the Emperor asked .
&quot; Another garden world full of gentle things ? &quot;
&quot; The Fremen have the word of Muad &apos;Dib , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; There will be flowing water here open to the sky and green <unk> rich with good things .
But we have the spice to think of , too .
Thus , there will always be desert on Arrakis .
.
.
and fierce winds , and <unk> to <unk> a man .
We Fremen have a saying : &apos; God created Arrakis to train the <unk> . &apos;
One cannot go against the word of God . &quot;
The old Truthsayer , the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam , had her own view of the hidden meaning in Paul &apos;s words now .
She glimpsed the jihad and said : &quot; You cannot loose these people upon the universe ! &quot;
&quot; You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardaukar ! &quot;
Paul snapped .
&quot; You cannot , &quot; she whispered .
&quot; You &apos;re a Truthsayer , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Review your words . &quot;
He glanced at the Princess Royal , back to the Emperor .
&quot; <unk> be done quickly , Majesty . &quot;
The Emperor turned a <unk> look upon his daughter .
She touched his arm , spoke <unk> : &quot; For this I was trained , Father . &quot;
He took a deep breath .
&quot; You cannot stay this thing , &quot; the old Truthsayer muttered .
The Emperor straightened , standing stiffly with a look of remembered dignity .
&quot; Who will negotiate for you , <unk> ? &quot;
he asked .
Paul turned , saw his mother , her eyes <unk> , standing with Chani in a squad of Fedaykin guards .
He crossed to them , stood looking down at Chani .
&quot; I know the reasons , &quot; Chani whispered .
&quot; If it must be .
.
.
Usul . &quot;
Paul , hearing the secret tears in her voice , touched her cheek .
&quot; My Sihaya need fear nothing , ever , &quot; he whispered .
He dropped his arm , faced his mother .
&quot; You will negotiate for me .
Mother , with Chani by your side .
She has wisdom and sharp eyes .
And it is <unk> said that no one <unk> tougher than a Fremen .
She will be looking through the eyes of her love for me and with the thought of her sons to be , what they will need .
Listen to her . &quot;
Jessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son , put down a shudder .
&quot; What are your <unk> ? &quot;
she asked .
&quot; The Emperor &apos;s entire CHOAM Company <unk> as <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
She was shocked almost <unk> .
&quot; He is to be <unk> .
I &apos;ll want an <unk> and CHOAM directorship for Gurney Halleck , and him in the fief of Caladan .
There will be <unk> and <unk> power for every <unk> Atreides man , not <unk> the <unk> trooper . &quot;
&quot; What of the Fremen ? &quot;
Jessica asked .
&quot; The Fremen are mine , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; What they receive shall be <unk> by Muad &apos;Dib .
It &apos;ll begin with Stilgar as <unk> on Arrakis , but that can wait . &quot;
&quot; And for me ? &quot;
Jessica asked .
&quot; Is there something you wish ? &quot;
&quot; Perhaps Caladan , &quot; she said , looking at Gurney .
&quot; I &apos;m not certain .
I &apos;ve become too much the Fremen .
.
.
and the Reverend Mother .
I need a time of peace and stillness in which to think . &quot;
&quot; That you shall have , &quot; Paul said , &quot; and anything else that Gurney or I can give you . &quot;
Jessica nodded , feeling suddenly old and tired .
She looked at Chani .
&quot; And for the royal concubine ? &quot;
&quot; No title for me , &quot; Chani whispered .
&quot; Nothing .
I <unk> of you . &quot;
Paul stared down into her eyes , remembering her suddenly as she had stood once with little Leto in her arms , their child now dead in this violence .
&quot; I swear to you now , &quot; he whispered , &quot; that you &apos;ll need no title .
That woman over there will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing and we must <unk> peace out of this moment , enlist the Great Houses of the Landsraad .
We must obey the forms .
Yet that princess shall have no more of me than my name .
No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance , nor instant of desire . &quot;
&quot; So you say now , &quot; Chani said .
She glanced across the room at the tail princess .
&quot; Do you know so little of my son ? &quot;
Jessica whispered .
&quot; See that princess standing there , so <unk> and confident .
They say she has <unk> of a <unk> nature .
Let us hope she finds <unk> in such things ; she &apos;ll have little else . &quot;
A bitter laugh escaped Jessica .
&quot; Think on it , Chani : that princess will have the name , yet she &apos;ll live as less than a concubine -- never to know a moment of <unk> from the man to whom she &apos;s bound .
While we , Chani , we who carry the name of concubine -- history will call us wives . &quot;
= = = = = = Appendix I : The <unk> of Dune Beyond a critical point within a <unk> space , freedom <unk> as numbers increase .
This is as true of humans in the <unk> space of a planetary <unk> as it is of gas <unk> in a sealed <unk> .
The human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system , but what kind of existence is possible for those who do survive .
<unk> Kynes , First Planetologist of Arrakis The effect of Arrakis on the mind of the <unk> usually is that of <unk> barren land .
The stranger might think nothing could live or grow in the open here , that this was the true wasteland that had never been <unk> and never would be .
To <unk> Kynes , the planet was merely an expression of energy , a machine being driven by its sun .
What it needed was <unk> to fit it to man &apos;s needs .
His mind went directly to the <unk> human population , the Fremen .
What a challenge !
What a tool they could be !
Fremen : an ecological and geological force of almost <unk> potential .
A direct and simple man in many ways , <unk> Kynes .
One must evade Harkonnen <unk> ?
<unk> .
Then one <unk> a Fremen woman .
When she gives you a Fremen son , you begin with him , with Liet-Kynes , and the other children , teaching them ecological <unk> , <unk> a new language with symbols that arm the mind to <unk> an entire landscape , its climate , <unk> limits , and finally to break through all ideas of force into the <unk> awareness of order .
&quot; There &apos;s an <unk> recognized beauty of motion and balance on any <unk> planet , &quot; Kynes said .
&quot; You see in this beauty a <unk> <unk> effect essential to all life .
Its aim is simple ; to maintain and produce <unk> patterns of greater and greater <unk> .
Life <unk> the closed system &apos;s capacity to sustain life .
Life -- all life -- is in the service of life .
<unk> <unk> are made available to life by life in greater and greater <unk> as the <unk> of life <unk> .
The entire landscape comes alive , filled with relationships and relationships within relationships . &quot;
This was <unk> Kynes lecturing to a sietch warren class .
Before the <unk> , though , he had to <unk> the Fremen .
To understand how this came about , you must first understand the enormous <unk> , the <unk> with which he approached any problem .
He was not naive , he merely permitted himself no <unk> .
He was exploring the Arrakis landscape in a <unk> <unk> one hot afternoon when he stumbled onto a <unk> common scene .
<unk> Harkonnen <unk> , shielded and fully armed , had trapped three Fremen youths in the open behind the Shield Wall near the village of <unk> .
To Kynes , it was a <unk> battle , more <unk> then real , until he focused on the fact that the Harkonnens intended to kill the Fremen .
By this time , one of the youths was down with a <unk> <unk> , two of the <unk> were down as well , but it was still four armed men against two <unk> .
Kynes wasn &apos;t brave ; he merely had that <unk> and caution .
The Harkonnens were killing Fremen .
They were destroying the tools with which he intended to <unk> a planet !
He <unk> his own shield , waded in and had two of the Harkonnens dead with a <unk> before they knew anyone was behind them .
He dodged a sword thrust from one of the others , slit the man &apos;s throat with a <unk> <unk> , and left the <unk> remaining <unk> to the two Fremen youths , turning his full attention to saving the lad on the ground .
And save the lad he did .
.
.
while the <unk> Harkonnen was being <unk> .
Now here was a pretty <unk> of <unk> !
The Fremen didn &apos;t know what to make of Kynes .
They knew who he was , of course .
No man arrived on Arrakis without a full <unk> finding its way into the Fremen <unk> .
They knew him : he was an Imperial servant .
But he killed Harkonnens !
<unk> might have shrugged and , with some regret , sent his shade to join those of the six dead men on the ground .
But these Fremen were <unk> youths and all they could see was that they <unk> this Imperial servant a mortal <unk> .
Kynes wound up two days later in a sietch that looked down on <unk> Pass .
To him , it was all very natural .
He talked to the Fremen about water , about dunes <unk> by grass , about palmaries filled with date palms , about open <unk> flowing across the desert .
He talked and talked and talked .
All around him raged a <unk> that Kynes never saw .
What to do with this madman ?
He knew the <unk> of a major sietch .
What to do ?
What of his words , this mad talk about a paradise on Arrakis ?
Just talk .
He knows too much .
But he killed Harkonnens !
What of the water burden ?
When did we owe the Imperium anything ?
He killed Harkonnens .
Anyone can kill Harkonnens .
I have done it myself .
But what of this talk about the <unk> of Arrakis ?
Very simple : Where is the water for this ?
He says it is here !
And he did save three of ours .
He saved three fools who had put themselves in the way of the Harkonnen fist !
And he has seen <unk> !
The necessary decision was known for hours before it was <unk> .
The tau of a sietch tells its members what they must do ; even the most brutal necessity is known .
An experienced fighter was sent with a consecrated knife to do the job .
Two <unk> followed him to get the water from the body .
<unk> necessity .
It &apos;s <unk> that Kynes even focused on his <unk> executioner .
He was talking to a group that spread around him at a cautious distance .
He walked as he talked : a short circle , <unk> .
Open water , Kynes said .
<unk> in the open without stillsuits .
Water for dipping it out of a <unk> !
<unk> !
The <unk> confronted him .
&quot; <unk> yourself , &quot; Kynes said , and went on talking about secret windtraps .
He brushed past the man .
Kynes &apos; back stood open for the <unk> blow .
What went on in that <unk> executioner &apos;s mind cannot be known now .
Did he finally listen to Kynes and believe ?
Who knows ?
But what he did is a matter of record .
<unk> was his name , <unk> Liet .
<unk> walked three paces and deliberately fell on his own knife , thus &quot; removing &quot; himself .
<unk> ?
Some say Shai-hulud moved him .
<unk> about <unk> !
From that instant , Kynes had but to point , saying &quot; Go there . &quot;
<unk> Fremen tribes went .
Men died , women died , children died .
But they went .
Kynes returned to his Imperial chores , directing the <unk> Testing <unk> .
And now , Fremen began to appear among the Station personnel .
The Fremen looked at each other .
They were infiltrating the &quot; system , &quot; a possibility they &apos;d never considered .
Station tools began finding their way into the sietch <unk> -- especially <unk> which were used to dig underground <unk> and hidden windtraps .
Water began collecting in the basins .
It became apparent to the Fremen that Kynes was not a madman totally , just mad enough to be holy .
He was one of the <unk> , the brotherhood of <unk> .
The shade of <unk> was advanced to the <unk> , the throne of <unk> <unk> .
Kynes -- direct , <unk> intent Kynes -- knew that <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> to produce nothing new .
He set up <unk> <unk> with regular interchange of data for a swift <unk> effect , let each group find its own path .
They must <unk> <unk> of tiny facts .
He <unk> only <unk> and rough <unk> tests to put their <unk> into <unk> .
<unk> <unk> were made <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> were developed on the long <unk> of weather that are called climate .
He found that in the wide belt contained by the <unk> lines , north and south , <unk> for <unk> of years hadn &apos;t gone outside the <unk> degrees ( absolute ) range , and that this belt had long growing seasons where <unk> <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> degrees absolute : the &quot; <unk> &quot; range for terraform life .
.
.
once they <unk> the water problem .
When will we solve it ?
the Fremen asked .
When will we see Arrakis as a paradise ?
In the manner of a teacher answering a child who has asked the sum of 2 plus 2 , Kynes told them : &quot; From three hundred to five hundred years . &quot;
A <unk> folk might have <unk> in <unk> .
But the Fremen had learned patience from men with <unk> .
It was a bit longer than they had anticipated , but they all could see that the blessed day was coming .
They tightened their <unk> and went back to work .
<unk> , the <unk> made the <unk> of paradise more real .
The concern on Arrakis was not with water , but with moisture .
<unk> were almost unknown , stock animals rare .
Some smugglers <unk> the <unk> desert ass , the <unk> , but the water price was high even when the beasts were fitted with modified stillsuits .
Kynes thought of <unk> <unk> plants to recover water from the <unk> and oxygen locked in native rock , but the <unk> factor was far too high .
The polar caps ( <unk> the false sense of water security they gave the <unk> ) held far too small an amount for his project .
.
.
and he already suspected where the water had to be .
There was that <unk> increase of moisture at <unk> <unk> , and in certain winds .
There was that <unk> clue in the air balance -- <unk> per cent oxygen , <unk> per cent <unk> and <unk> per cent carbon <unk> -- with the trace <unk> taking up the rest .
There was a rare native root plant that grew above the <unk> meter level in the northern <unk> zone .
A <unk> two meters long <unk> half a <unk> of water .
And there were the terraform desert plants : the tougher ones showed signs of <unk> if planted in depressions lined with dew precipitators .
Then Kynes saw the salt pan .
His &apos; thopter , <unk> between stations far out on the <unk> , was <unk> off course by a storm .
When the storm passed , there was the pan -- a giant oval depression some three hundred kilometers on the long axis -- a glaring white surprise in the open desert .
Kynes landed , tasted the pan &apos;s <unk> surface .
<unk> .
Now , he was certain .
There &apos;d been open water on Arrakis -- once .
He began <unk> the evidence of the dry <unk> where <unk> of water had appeared and <unk> , never to return .
Kynes set his newly trained Fremen <unk> to work : their chief clue , leathery <unk> of matter sometimes found with the <unk> after a blow .
This had been <unk> to a <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in Fremen folk stories .
As facts grew into evidence , a creature emerged to explain these leathery <unk> -- a <unk> that blocked off water into <unk> pockets within the porous lower <unk> below the <unk>   ( absolute ) line .
This &quot; <unk> &quot; died by the <unk> in each <unk> .
A <unk> change in temperature could kill it .
The few survivors entered a <unk> <unk> to emerge in six years as small ( about three meters long ) sandworms .
Of these , only a few avoided their larger <unk> and pre-spice water pockets to emerge into <unk> as the giant shai-hulud .
( Water is poisonous to shai-hulud as the Fremen had long known from drowning the rare &quot; <unk> worm &quot; of the Minor <unk> to produce the <unk> narcotic they call Water of Life .
The &quot; <unk> worm &quot; is a primitive form of shai-hulud that reaches a length of only about nine meters . )
Now they had the <unk> relationship : little maker to pre-spice mass ; little maker to shai-hulud ; shai-hulud to scatter the spice upon which fed <unk> creatures called sand <unk> ; the sand <unk> , food for shai-hulud , growing , <unk> , becoming little makers .
Kynes and his people turned their attention from these great relationships and focused now on <unk> .
First , the climate : the sand surface often reached <unk> of <unk>   to <unk>   ( absolute ) .
A foot below ground it might be <unk>   <unk> ; a foot above ground , <unk>   <unk> .
<unk> or black shade could provide another <unk>   of <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> : sand of Arrakis is mostly a product of worm <unk> ; dust ( the truly omnipresent problem there ) is produced by the constant surface <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; movement of sand .
<unk> grains are found on the <unk> sides of dunes .
The windward side is packed smooth and hard .
Old dunes are yellow ( <unk> ) , young dunes are the color of the <unk> rock -- usually gray .
<unk> sides of old dunes <unk> the first <unk> areas .
The Fremen aimed first for a cycle of <unk> grass with <unk> hair <unk> to <unk> , <unk> and fix the dunes by <unk> the wind of its big weapon : <unk> grains .
<unk> zones were laid out in the deep south far from Harkonnen watchers .
The mutated <unk> grasses were planted first along the <unk> ( <unk> ) of the chosen dunes that stood across the path of the prevailing <unk> .
With the <unk> face <unk> , the windward face grew higher and higher and the grass was moved to keep pace .
<unk> <unk> ( long dunes with <unk> crest ) of more than <unk> meters height were produced this way .
When barrier dunes reached sufficient height , the windward faces were planted with tougher sword grasses .
Each structure on a base about six times as thick as its height was <unk> -- &quot; fixed . &quot;
Now , they came in with deeper plantings -- <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> to begin ) , then <unk> <unk> , low <unk> , <unk> <unk> ( the type adapted for Caladan &apos;s northern reaches ) , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- then the true desert <unk> : <unk> , saguaro , and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Where it would grow , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> grass , <unk> <unk> grass , wild <unk> , burrow bush , sand <unk> , evening <unk> , <unk> bush , smoke tree , creosote bush .
They turned then to the necessary animal life -- <unk> creatures to open the soil and <unk> it : kit fox , kangaroo mouse , desert hare , sand <unk> .
.
.
and the <unk> to keep them in check : desert hawk , <unk> owl , eagle and desert owl ; and insects to fill the <unk> these couldn &apos;t reach : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the biting <unk> and the <unk> .
.
.
and the desert bat to keep watch on these .
Now came the <unk> test : date palms , <unk> , <unk> , coffee , <unk> -- more than <unk> selected food plant types to test and <unk> .
&quot; The thing the <unk> <unk> don &apos;t realize about an <unk> , &quot; Kynes said , &quot; is that it &apos;s a system .
A system !
A system <unk> a certain fluid <unk> that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one <unk> .
A system has order , a flowing from point to point .
If something <unk> that flow , order <unk> .
The <unk> might miss that collapse until it was too late .
That &apos;s why the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences . &quot;
Had they achieved a system ?
Kynes and his people watched and waited .
The Fremen now knew what he meant by an <unk> prediction to five hundred years .
A report came up from the palmaries : At the desert edge of the plantings , the sand <unk> is being poisoned through <unk> with the new forms of life .
The reason : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> water was forming there which the Arrakis life would not touch .
A barren zone surrounded the plantings and even shai-hulud would not <unk> it .
Kynes went down to the palmaries himself -- a <unk> trip ( in a <unk> like a wounded man or Reverend Mother because he never became a sandrider ) .
He tested the barren zone ( it <unk> to heaven ) and came up with a bonus , a gift from Arrakis .
The addition of <unk> and fixed <unk> <unk> the barren zone to a rich plant bed for terraform life .
The plantings could be advanced at will !
&quot; Does this change the timing ? &quot;
the Fremen asked .
Kynes went back to his planetary <unk> .
<unk> figures were fairly secure by then .
He was generous with his <unk> , knowing he couldn &apos;t draw <unk> lines around ecological problems .
A certain amount of plant cover had to be set aside to hold dunes in place ; a certain amount for <unk> ( both human and animal ) ; a certain amount to lock moisture in root <unk> and to feed water out into surrounding <unk> areas .
They &apos;d <unk> the <unk> cold spots on the open <unk> by this time .
These had to be figured into the <unk> .
Even shai-hulud had a place in the charts .
He must never be destroyed , else spice wealth would end .
But his inner <unk> &quot; factory , &quot; with its enormous <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , was a giant source of oxygen .
A <unk> worm ( about <unk> meters long ) <unk> into the <unk> as much oxygen as ten square kilometers of green growing <unk> surface .
He had the Guild to consider .
The spice <unk> to the Guild for preventing weather satellites and other watchers in the skies of Arrakis already had reached major <unk> .
Nor could the Fremen be ignored .
Especially the Fremen , with their windtraps and <unk> <unk> <unk> around water supply ; the Fremen with their new ecological <unk> and their dream of <unk> vast areas of Arrakis through a <unk> phase into <unk> cover .
From the charts emerged a figure .
Kynes reported it .
Three per cent .
If they could get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in forming carbon <unk> , they &apos;d have their self-sustaining cycle .
&quot; But how long ? &quot;
the Fremen demanded .
&quot; Oh , that : about three hundred and fifty years . &quot;
So it was true as this <unk> had said in the beginning : the thing would not come in the lifetime of any man now living , nor in the lifetime of their <unk> eight times removed , but it would come .
The work continued : building , planting , digging , training the children .
Then <unk> was killed in the <unk> at <unk> Basin .
By this time his son , Liet-Kynes , was <unk> , a full Fremen and sandrider who had killed more than a hundred Harkonnens .
The Imperial <unk> for which the <unk> Kynes already had applied in the name of his son was <unk> as a matter of course .
The rigid class structure of the faufreluches had its <unk> purpose here .
The son had been trained to follow the father .
The course had been set by this time , the <unk> were aimed along their way .
Liet-Kynes had only to watch and <unk> and spy upon the Harkonnens .
.
.
until the day his planet was <unk> by a <unk> .
= = = = = = Appendix <unk> : The Religion of Dune Before the coming of Muad &apos;Dib , the Fremen of Arrakis <unk> a religion whose roots in the <unk> <unk> are there for any <unk> to see .
Many have <unk> the extensive <unk> from other religions .
The most common example is the <unk> to Water , a direct <unk> from the Orange Catholic <unk> Manual , calling for rain clouds which Arrakis had never seen .
But there are more profound points of <unk> between the Kitab al-Ibar of the Fremen and the teachings of Bible , <unk> , and <unk> .
Any <unk> of the religious <unk> dominant in the Imperium up to the time of Muad &apos;Dib must start with the major forces which shaped those <unk> : 1 .
The followers of the <unk> <unk> , whose Book was the Orange Catholic Bible , and whose <unk> are expressed in the Commentaries and other <unk> produced by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
( C.E.T.
) ; 2 .
The Bene Gesserit , who privately denied they were a religious order , but who <unk> behind an almost <unk> screen of ritual <unk> , and whose training , whose <unk> , <unk> , and internal teaching methods were almost <unk> religious ; <unk> .
The <unk> ruling class ( including the Guild ) for whom religion was a kind of puppet show to <unk> the <unk> and keep it <unk> , and who believed <unk> that all <unk> -- even religious <unk> -- could be reduced to mechanical <unk> ; <unk> .
The so-called <unk> <unk> -- including those preserved by the Zensunni Wanderers from the first , second , and third <unk> movements ; the <unk> of Chusuk , the <unk> <unk> of the types dominant at Lankiveil and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> Delta <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> on Salusa Secundus , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> with its pure <unk> and <unk> preserved among the <unk> rice <unk> of Caladan , the <unk> outcroppings found all through the universe in little pockets of <unk> <unk> , and finally , the Butlerian Jihad .
There is a fifth force which shaped religious belief , but its effect is so <unk> and profound that it deserves to stand alone .
This is , of course , space travel -- and in any discussion of religion , it deserves to be written thus : <unk> <unk> !
<unk> &apos;s movement through deep space placed a unique stamp on religion during the one hundred and ten centuries that preceded the Butlerian Jihad .
To begin with , early space travel , although <unk> , was largely <unk> , slow , and uncertain , and , before the Guild monopoly , was accomplished by a <unk> of methods .
The first space experiences , <unk> <unk> and subject to extreme <unk> , were a wild <unk> to mystical <unk> .
Immediately , space gave a different <unk> and sense to ideas of <unk> .
That difference is seen even in the highest religious <unk> of the period .
All through religion , the feeling of the sacred was touched by <unk> from the outer dark .
It was as though <unk> in all his descendant forms retreated into the <unk> darkness to be <unk> by a female <unk> filled with <unk> and with a face of many terrors .
The ancient <unk> <unk> , <unk> together as they were fitted to the needs of new <unk> and new <unk> symbols .
It was a time of struggle between <unk> on the one side and the old prayers and <unk> on the other .
There was never a clear decision .
<unk> this period , it was said that <unk> was <unk> , permitting God to say : &quot; <unk> and <unk> , and fill the universe , and subdue it , and rule over all manner of strange beasts and living creatures in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> and beneath them . &quot;
It was a time of <unk> whose powers were real .
The measure of them is seen in the fact they never <unk> how they grasped the <unk> .
Then came the Butlerian Jihad -- two generations of chaos .
The <unk> of <unk> was <unk> among the masses and a new <unk> was raised : &quot; Man may not be replaced . &quot;
Those two generations of violence were a <unk> pause for all <unk> .
Men looked at their gods and their <unk> and saw that both were filled with that most terrible of all <unk> : fear over <unk> .
<unk> , the leaders of religions whose followers had spilled the blood of billions began meeting to exchange <unk> .
It was a move <unk> by the Spacing Guild , which was beginning to build its monopoly over all <unk> travel , and by the Bene Gesserit who were <unk> the <unk> .
Out of those first <unk> <unk> came two major <unk> : 1 .
The realization that all religions had at least one common <unk> : &quot; Thou shall not <unk> the soul . &quot;
2 .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
C.E.T.
<unk> on a <unk> island of Old <unk> , <unk> ground of the mother religions .
They met &quot; in the common belief that there <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the universe . &quot;
Every faith with more than a million followers was represented , and they reached a <unk> immediate agreement on the statement of their common goal : &quot; We are here to remove a <unk> weapon from the hands of <unk> religions .
That weapon -- the claim to possession of the one and only revelation . &quot;
<unk> at this &quot; sign of profound <unk> &quot; proved <unk> .
For more than a standard year , that statement was the only <unk> from C.E.T.
Men spoke bitterly of the delay .
<unk> composed <unk> , biting songs about the one hundred and <unk> &quot; Old <unk> &quot; as the C.E.T.
delegates came to be called .
( The name arose from a <unk> joke which played on the C.E.T.
<unk> and called the delegates &quot; <unk> . &quot; )
One of the songs , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; has undergone <unk> <unk> and is popular even today : &quot; Consider <unk> .
<unk> repose -- and The <unk> In all of those <unk> !
All those <unk> !
So <unk> -- so <unk> Through all your days .
Time has <unk> &apos;d for M &apos;Lord <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> rumors <unk> out of the C.E.T.
<unk> .
It was said they were <unk> <unk> and , <unk> , the <unk> were named .
Such rumors <unk> provoked <unk> riots and , of course , inspired new <unk> .
Two years passed .
.
.
three years .
The <unk> , nine of their original number having died and been replaced , paused to observe formal <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> they were <unk> to produce one book , <unk> out &quot; all the <unk> <unk> &quot; of the religious past .
&quot; We are producing an instrument of <unk> to be played in all ways , &quot; they said .
Many consider it odd that this statement provoked the worst <unk> of violence against <unk> .
<unk> delegates were recalled by their <unk> .
One committed <unk> by <unk> a space frigate and <unk> it into the sun .
<unk> estimate the riots took eighty million lives .
That works out to about six thousand for each world then in the Landsraad <unk> .
<unk> the unrest of the time , this may not be an <unk> estimate , although any pretense to real accuracy in the figure must be just that -- pretense .
<unk> between worlds was at one of its <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> , quite naturally , had a field day .
A popular musical <unk> of the period had one of the C.E.T.
delegates sitting on a white sand beach beneath a palm tree singing : &quot; For God , woman and the <unk> of love We <unk> here <unk> fears or <unk> .
<unk> !
<unk> , sing another <unk> For God , Woman and the <unk> of love ! &quot;
<unk> and <unk> are but <unk> of the times , <unk> revealing .
They betray the <unk> tone , the deep <unk> .
.
.
and the <unk> for something better , plus the fear that nothing would come of it all .
The major <unk> against <unk> in these times were the <unk> Guild , the Bene Gesserit and the Landsraad , which continued its <unk> record of meeting in spite of the <unk> <unk> .
The Guild &apos;s part appears clear : they gave free transport for all Landsraad and C.E.T.
business .
The Bene Gesserit role is more <unk> .
Certainly , this is the time in which they <unk> their hold upon the <unk> , <unk> the subtle narcotics , developed <unk> training and conceived the Missionaria Protectiva , that black arm of <unk> .
But it is also the period that saw the <unk> of the <unk> against Fear and the assembly of the Azhar Book , that <unk> <unk> that <unk> the great <unk> of the most ancient <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> is perhaps the only one possible : &quot; Those were times of deep <unk> . &quot;
For almost seven years , then , C.E.T.
<unk> .
And as their <unk> <unk> approached , they prepared the human universe for a <unk> <unk> .
On that <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the Orange Catholic Bible .
&quot; Here is a work with dignity and meaning , &quot; they said .
&quot; Here is a way to make humanity aware of itself as a total <unk> of God . &quot;
The men of C.E.T.
were <unk> to <unk> of ideas , inspired by God in the <unk> of <unk> .
It was said they had brought to light &quot; the <unk> of great <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of centuries , &quot; that they had &quot; <unk> the moral <unk> that come out of a religious conscience . &quot;
With the O.C.
Bible , C.E.T.
presented the <unk> Manual and the Commentaries -- in many respects a more <unk> work , not only because of its <unk> ( less than half the size of the O.C.
Bible ) , but also because of its candor and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
The beginning is an obvious appeal to the <unk> rulers .
&quot; Men , finding no answers to the <unk> &#91; the ten thousand religious questions from the <unk> &#93; now <unk> their own reasoning .
All men seek to be <unk> .
Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have <unk> to make sense out of God &apos;s universe .
<unk> seek the <unk> of <unk> .
It is the task of Religion to fit man into this <unk> . &quot;
In their <unk> , though , the Commentaries set a harsh tone that very likely <unk> their fate .
&quot; Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life .
True religion must teach that life is filled with <unk> <unk> to the eye of God , that knowledge without action is empty .
All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and <unk> is largely a <unk> .
The proper teaching is recognized with ease .
You can know it without fail because it <unk> within you that sensation which tells you this is something you &apos;ve always known . &quot;
There was an odd sense of calm as the <unk> and shigawire <unk> rolled and the O.C.
Bible spread out through the worlds .
Some interpreted this as a sign from God , an omen of <unk> .
But even the C.E.T.
delegates betrayed the <unk> of that calm as they returned to their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of them were <unk> within two months .
<unk> <unk> within the year .
The O.C.
Bible was <unk> as a work produced by &quot; the <unk> of reason . &quot;
It was said that its pages were filled with a <unk> interest in logic .
<unk> that <unk> to popular <unk> began <unk> .
These <unk> leaned on accepted <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the thin <unk> , and the like ) and it soon became apparent that the ancient superstitions and <unk> had not been absorbed by the new <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s label for C.E.T.
&apos;s <unk> effort -- &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; -- was snapped up by eager billions who interpreted the <unk> <unk> as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
C.E.T.
<unk> <unk> Bomoko , an <unk> of the <unk> and one of the fourteen delegates who never <unk> ( &quot; The <unk> <unk> &quot; of popular history ) , appeared to admit finally the C.E.T.
had <unk> .
&quot; We shouldn &apos;t have tried to create new symbols , &quot; he said .
&quot; We should &apos;ve realized we weren &apos;t supposed to <unk> <unk> into accepted belief , that we weren &apos;t supposed to stir up <unk> about God .
We are <unk> confronted by the terrifying <unk> of all things human , yet we permit our religions to grow more rigid and controlled , more <unk> and oppressive .
What is this shadow across the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
It is a warning that <unk> endure , that symbols endure when their meaning is lost , that there is no <unk> of all <unk> knowledge . &quot;
The bitter double edge in this &quot; <unk> &quot; did not escape Bomoko &apos;s <unk> and he was forced soon afterward to flee into exile , his life dependent upon the Guild &apos;s <unk> of secrecy .
He <unk> died on Tupile , honored and beloved , his last words : &quot; Religion must remain an <unk> for people who say to themselves , &apos; I am not the kind of person I want to be . &apos;
It must never sink into an <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
It is pleasant to think that Bomoko understood the prophecy in his words : &quot; <unk> endure . &quot;
<unk> generations later , the O.C.
Bible and the Commentaries permeated the religious universe .
When Paul-Muad &apos;Dib stood with his right hand on the rock shrine enclosing his father &apos;s skull ( the right hand of the blessed , not the left hand of the damned ) he quoted word for word from &quot; Bomoko &apos;s <unk> &quot; -- &quot; You who have defeated us say to yourselves that <unk> is fallen and its works have been <unk> .
I say to you still that man remains on trial , each man in his own <unk> .
Each man is a little war . &quot;
The Fremen said of Muad &apos;Dib that he was like <unk> <unk> whose frigate defied the Guild and rode one day &apos; there &apos; and back .
<unk> &apos; used in this way <unk> directly from the Fremen mythology as the land of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> where all limitations are removed .
The parallel between this and the Kwisatz Haderach is <unk> seen .
The Kwisatz Haderach that the <unk> sought through its breeding program was interpreted as &quot; The <unk> of the way &quot; or &quot; The one who can be two places <unk> . &quot;
But both of these interpretations can be shown to stem directly from the Commentaries : &quot; When law and religious duty are one , your <unk> <unk> the universe . &quot;
Of himself , Muad &apos;Dib said : &quot; I am a <unk> in the sea of time , free to sweep future and past .
I am a moving <unk> from whom no possibility can escape . &quot;
These thoughts are all one and the same and they <unk> to <unk> Kalima in the O.C.
Bible where it says : &quot; <unk> a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and has powers of reality . &quot;
It is when we get into Muad &apos;Dib &apos;s own <unk> in &quot; The <unk> of the Universe &quot; as interpreted by his holy men , the <unk> <unk> , that we see his real <unk> to C.E.T.
and <unk> .
Muad &apos;Dib : &quot; Law and duty are one ; so be it .
But remember these limitations -- Thus are you never fully <unk> .
Thus do you remain immersed in the <unk> tau .
Thus are you always less than an individual . &quot;
O.C.
Bible : <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> <unk> . )
Muad &apos;Dib : &quot; Religion often <unk> of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future . &quot;
C.E.T.
Commentaries : <unk> <unk> .
( The Azhar Book traces this statement to the first <unk> religious <unk> , <unk> ; through a <unk> . )
Muad &apos;Dib : &quot; If a child , an <unk> person , an <unk> person , or an <unk> person <unk> trouble , it is the fault of authority for not <unk> and preventing that trouble . &quot;
O.C.
Bible : &quot; Any <unk> can be <unk> , at least in part , to a natural bad <unk> that is an <unk> <unk> <unk> to God . &quot;
( The Azhar Book traces this to the ancient <unk> <unk> . )
Muad &apos;Dib : &quot; <unk> forth thy hand and eat what God has <unk> thee ; and when thou are <unk> , praise the Lord . &quot;
O.C.
Bible : a <unk> with <unk> meaning .
( The Azhar Book traces this in slightly different form to First <unk> . )
Muad &apos;Dib : &quot; <unk> is the beginning of cruelty . &quot;
Fremen Kitab al-Ibar : &quot; The weight of a <unk> God is a fearful thing .
Did not God give us the burning sun ( <unk> ) ?
Did not God give us the Mothers of <unk> ( Reverend Mothers ) ?
Did not God give us Shaitan ( <unk> , <unk> ) ?
From Shaitan did we not get the <unk> of speed ? &quot;
( This is the source of the Fremen saying : &quot; Speed comes from Shaitan . &quot;
Consider : for every one hundred <unk> of heat <unk> by exercise &#91; speed &#93; the body <unk> about six <unk> of perspiration .
The Fremen word for perspiration is <unk> or tears and , in one <unk> , <unk> : &quot; The life essence that Shaitan <unk> from your soul . &quot; )
Muad &apos;Dib &apos;s <unk> is called &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; by <unk> , but timing had little to do with it .
As Muad &apos;Dib himself said : &quot; I am here ; so .
.
. &quot;
It is , however , vital to an understanding of Muad &apos;Dib &apos;s religious impact that you never lose sight of one fact : the Fremen were a desert people whose entire ancestry was accustomed to hostile <unk> .
<unk> isn &apos;t difficult when you survive each second by <unk> open hostility .
&quot; You are there -- so .
.
. &quot;
With such a tradition , <unk> is accepted -- perhaps as unconscious punishment , but accepted .
And it &apos;s well to note that Fremen ritual gives almost complete freedom from guilt feelings .
This isn &apos;t <unk> because their law and religion were <unk> , making <unk> a <unk> .
It &apos;s likely closer to the mark to say they cleansed themselves of guilt easily because their <unk> existence required brutal judgments ( often deadly ) which in a <unk> land would burden men with unbearable guilt .
This is likely one of the roots of Fremen emphasis on <unk> ( <unk> the Missionaria Protectiva &apos;s <unk> ) .
What matter that <unk> sands are an omen ?
What matter that you must make the sign of the fist when first you see First <unk> ?
A man &apos;s flesh is his own and his water belongs to the tribe -- and the mystery of life isn &apos;t a problem to solve but a reality to experience .
<unk> help you remember this .
And because you are here , because you have the religion , victory cannot evade you in the end .
As the Bene Gesserit taught for centuries , long before they ran <unk> of the Fremen : &quot; When religion and politics ride the same <unk> , when that <unk> is driven by a living holy man ( <unk> ) , nothing can stand in their path . &quot;
= = = = = = Appendix <unk> : <unk> on Bene Gesserit <unk> and <unk> Here follows an <unk> from the <unk> prepared by her own agents at the request of the Lady Jessica immediately after the Arrakis Affair .
The candor of this report <unk> its value far beyond the ordinary .
Because the Bene Gesserit <unk> for centuries behind the blind of a <unk> school while carrying on their selective breeding program among humans , we <unk> to <unk> them with more <unk> than they appear to deserve .
<unk> of their &quot; trial of fact &quot; on the Arrakis Affair <unk> the school &apos;s profound <unk> of its own role .
It may be argued that the Bene Gesserit could examine only such facts as were available to them and had no direct access to the person of the <unk> Muad &apos;Dib .
But the school had <unk> greater <unk> and its error here goes deeper .
The Bene Gesserit program had as its target the breeding of a person they <unk> &quot; Kwisatz Haderach , &quot; a term <unk> &quot; one who can be many places at once . &quot;
In <unk> terms , what they sought was a human with mental powers permitting him to understand and use higher order dimensions .
They were breeding for a <unk> , a human <unk> with some of the prescient abilities found in Guild navigators .
Now , attend these facts carefully : Muad &apos;Dib , born Paul Atreides , was the son of the Duke Leto , a man whose bloodline had been watched carefully for more than a thousand years .
The <unk> &apos;s mother , Lady Jessica , was a natural daughter of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and carried <unk> whose supreme importance to the breeding program was known for almost two thousand years .
She was a Bene Gesserit <unk> and trained , and should have been a willing tool of the project .
The Lady Jessica was ordered to produce an Atreides daughter .
The plan was to <unk> this daughter with Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen , a nephew of the Baron Vladimir , with the high <unk> of a Kwisatz Haderach from that union .
Instead , for reasons she <unk> have never been completely clear to her , the concubine Lady Jessica defied her orders and bore a son .
This alone should have <unk> the Bene Gesserit to the possibility that a wild <unk> had entered their scheme .
But there were other far more important <unk> that they virtually ignored : 1 .
As a youth , Paul Atreides showed ability to <unk> the future .
He was known to have had prescient visions that were <unk> , penetrating , and defied <unk> explanation .
2 .
The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam , Bene Gesserit Proctor who tested Paul &apos;s humanity when he was fifteen , <unk> that he <unk> more agony in the test than any other human of record .
Yet she failed to make special note of this in her report !
<unk> .
When Family Atreides moved to the planet Arrakis , the Fremen population there <unk> the young Paul as a prophet , &quot; the voice from the outer world . &quot;
The Bene Gesserit were well aware that the rigors of such a planet as Arrakis with its <unk> of desert landscape , its absolute lack of open water , its emphasis on the most primitive necessities for survival , <unk> produces a high <unk> of <unk> .
Yet this Fremen reaction and the obvious element of the Arrakeen diet high in spice were <unk> over by Bene Gesserit observers .
<unk> .
When the Harkonnens and the <unk> of the Padishah Emperor <unk> Arrakis , killing Paul &apos;s father and most of the Atreides troops , Paul and his mother <unk> .
But almost immediately there were reports of a new religious leader among the Fremen , a man called Muad &apos;Dib , who again was <unk> as &quot; the voice from the outer world . &quot;
The reports <unk> clearly that he was accompanied by a new Reverend Mother of the Sayyadina <unk> &quot; who is the woman who bore him . &quot;
<unk> available to the Bene Gesserit <unk> in plain terms that the Fremen legends of the <unk> contained these words : &quot; He shall be born of a Bene Gesserit witch . &quot;
( It may be argued here that the Bene Gesserit sent their Missionaria Protectiva onto Arrakis centuries earlier to <unk> something like this legend as <unk> should any members of the school be trapped there and require sanctuary , and that this legend of &quot; the voice from the outer world &quot; was properly to be ignored because it appeared to be the standard Bene Gesserit <unk> .
But this would be true only if you <unk> that the Bene Gesserit were correct in ignoring the other clues about Paul-Muad &apos;Dib . )
<unk> .
When the Arrakis Affair boiled up , the Spacing Guild made <unk> to the Bene Gesserit .
The Guild hinted that its navigators , who use the spice drug of Arrakis to produce the limited prescience necessary for <unk> <unk> through the void , were &quot; bothered about the future &quot; or saw &quot; problems on the horizon . &quot;
This could only mean they saw a nexus , a meeting place of countless delicate decisions , beyond which the path was hidden from the prescient eye .
This was a clear indication that some <unk> was <unk> with higher order dimensions !
( A few of the Bene Gesserit had long been aware that the Guild could not interfere directly with the vital spice source because Guild navigators already were dealing in their own <unk> way with higher order dimensions , at least to the point where they recognized that the slightest misstep they made on Arrakis could be <unk> .
It was a known fact that Guild navigators could <unk> no way to take control of the spice without producing just such a nexus .
The obvious <unk> was that someone of higher order powers was taking control of the spice source , yet the Bene Gesserit missed this point entirely ! )
In the face of these facts , one is led to the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> Bene Gesserit <unk> in this affair was a product of an even higher plan of which they were completely <unk> !
