Kwisatz Haderach .
There had been so many things to learn .
Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul &apos;s mind whirled with the new knowledge .
Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet .
Thufir Hawat , his father &apos;s Master of Assassins , had explained it : their mortal enemies , the Harkonnens , had been on Arrakis eighty years , holding the planet in <unk> under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice , melange .
Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in <unk> -- an apparent victory for the Duke Leto .
Yet , Hawat had said , this appearance contained the <unk> peril , for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad .
&quot; A popular man <unk> the jealousy of the powerful , &quot; Hawat had said .
Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet .
Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern , silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes .
It was solemn there and like a <unk> as he listened to a faint sound -- the <unk> of water .
Even while he remained in the dream , Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening .
He always remembered the dreams that were <unk> .
The dream faded .
Paul <unk> to feel himself in the warmth of his bed -- thinking .
.
.
thinking .
This world of Castle Caladan , without play or companions his own age , perhaps did not deserve sadness in <unk> .
Dr. Yueh , his teacher , had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not <unk> guarded on Arrakis .
The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without <unk> or bashar to command them : <unk> &apos; <unk> people called Fremen , marked down on no <unk> of the Imperial <unk> .
Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet .
Paul sensed his own tensions , decided to practice one of the <unk> lessons his mother had taught him .
Three quick breaths <unk> the <unk> : he fell into the floating awareness .
.
.
focusing the consciousness .
.
.
<unk> <unk> .
.
.
avoiding the <unk> mechanism of consciousness .
.
.
to be conscious by choice .
.
.
blood <unk> and <unk> the <unk> regions .
.
.
one does not <unk> <unk> by instinct alone .
.
.
animal consciousness does not <unk> beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become <unk> .
.
.
the animal <unk> and does not produce .
.
.
animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the <unk> .
.
.
the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe .
.
.
focused consciousness by choice , this forms your grid .
.
.
<unk> <unk> follows <unk> flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs .
.
.
all things / cells / beings are <unk> .
.
.
<unk> for <unk> within .
.
.
Over and over and over within Paul &apos;s floating awareness the lesson rolled .
When dawn touched Paul &apos;s window sill with yellow light , he sensed it through closed eyelids , opened them , hearing then the <unk> <unk> and hurry in the castle , seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling .
The hall door opened and his mother peered in , hair like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the <unk> , her oval face <unk> and green eyes staring <unk> .
&quot; You &apos;re awake , &quot; she said .
&quot; Did you sleep well ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot;
He studied the tallness of her , saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet <unk> .
Another might have missed the tension , but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way -- in the minutiae of observation .
She turned , holding a <unk> jacket for him .
It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket .
&quot; Hurry and dress , &quot; she said .
&quot; Reverend Mother is waiting . &quot;
&quot; I dreamed of her once , &quot; Paul said .
&quot; Who is she ? &quot;
&quot; She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school .
Now , she &apos;s the Emperor &apos;s Truthsayer .
And Paul .
.
. &quot;
She hesitated .
&quot; You must tell her about your dreams . &quot;
&quot; I will .
Is she the reason we got Arrakis ? &quot;
&quot; We did not get Arrakis . &quot;
Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers , hung them with the jacket on the <unk> stand beside his bed .
&quot; Don &apos;t keep Reverend Mother waiting . &quot;
Paul sat up , hugged his knees .
&quot; What &apos;s a gom jabbar ? &quot;
Again , the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation , a nervous betrayal he felt as fear .
Jessica crossed to the window , flung wide the draperies , stared across the river <unk> toward <unk> <unk> .
&quot; You &apos;ll learn about .
.
.
the gom jabbar soon enough , &quot; she said .
He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it .
Jessica spoke without turning .
&quot; Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room .
Please hurry . &quot;
The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a <unk> chair watching mother and son approach .
<unk> on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green <unk> of the Atreides family holding , but the Reverend Mother ignored the view .
She was feeling her age this morning , more than a little <unk> .
She blamed it on space travel and association with that <unk> Spacing Guild and its secretive ways .
But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene <unk> .
Even the Padishah Emperor &apos;s Truthsayer couldn &apos;t evade that responsibility when the duty call came .
Damn that Jessica !
the Reverend Mother thought .
If only she &apos; d borne us a girl as she was ordered to do !
Jessica stopped three paces from the chair , dropped a small <unk> , a gentle <unk> of left hand along the line of her skirt .
Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught -- the one used &quot; when in doubt of another &apos;s station . &quot;
The <unk> of Paul &apos;s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother .
She said : &quot; He &apos;s a cautious one , Jessica . &quot;
Jessica &apos;s hand went to Paul &apos;s shoulder , tightened there .
For a heartbeat , fear <unk> through her palm .
Then she had herself under control .
&quot; Thus he has been taught , Your Reverence . &quot;
What does she fear ?
Paul wondered .
The old woman studied Paul in one <unk> flicker : face oval like Jessica &apos;s , but strong bones .
.
.
hair : the Duke &apos;s <unk> but with <unk> of the <unk> grandfather who cannot be named , and that thin , disdainful nose ; shape of directly staring green eyes : like the old Duke , the <unk> grandfather who is dead .
Now , there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura -- even in death , the Reverend Mother thought .
&quot; <unk> is one thing , &quot; she said , &quot; the basic <unk> is another .
We shall see . &quot;
The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica .
&quot; Leave us .
I <unk> you to practice the <unk> of peace . &quot;
Jessica took her hand from Paul &apos;s shoulder .
&quot; Your Reverence , I -- &quot; &quot; Jessica , you know it must be done . &quot;
Paul looked up at his mother , puzzled .
Jessica straightened .
&quot; Yes .
.
.
of course . &quot;
Paul looked back at the Reverend Mother .
<unk> and his mother &apos;s obvious awe of this old woman argued caution .
Yet he felt an angry <unk> at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother .
&quot; Paul .
.
. &quot;
Jessica took a deep breath .
&quot; .
.
.
this test you &apos;re about to receive .
.
.
it &apos;s important to me . &quot;
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
He looked up at her .
&quot; Remember that you &apos;re a duke &apos;s son , &quot; Jessica said .
She whirled and strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt .
The door closed <unk> behind her .
Paul faced the old woman , holding anger in check .
&quot; Does one dismiss the Lady Jessica as though she were a serving wench ? &quot;
A smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth .
&quot; The Lady Jessica was my serving wench , lad , for fourteen years at school . &quot;
She nodded .
&quot; And a good one , too .
Now , you come here ! &quot;
The command whipped out at him .
Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it .
Using the Voice on me , he thought .
He stopped at her gesture , standing beside her knees .
&quot; See this ? &quot;
she asked .
From the folds of her gown , she lifted a green metal <unk> about fifteen centimeters on a side .
She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open -- black and oddly frightening .
No light penetrated that open blackness .
&quot; Put your right hand in the box , &quot; she said .
Fear shot through Paul .
He started to back away , but the old woman said : &quot; Is this how you obey your mother ? &quot;
He looked up into bird-bright eyes .
Slowly , feeling the <unk> and unable to <unk> them , Paul put his hand into the box .
He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand , then <unk> metal against his fingers and a <unk> as though his hand were asleep .
A predatory look filled the old woman &apos;s features .
She lifted her right hand away from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul &apos;s neck .
He saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward &quot; Stop ! &quot;
she snapped .
Using the Voice again !
He swung his attention back to her face .
&quot; I hold at your neck the gom jabbar , &quot; she said .
&quot; The gom jabbar , the <unk> enemy .
It &apos;s a needle with a drop of poison on its tip .
<unk> !
Don &apos;t pull away or you &apos;ll feel that poison . &quot;
Paul tried to swallow in a dry throat .
He could not take his attention from the seamed old face , the glistening eyes , the pale <unk> around <unk> metal teeth that flashed as she spoke .
&quot; A duke &apos;s son must know about poisons , &quot; she said .
&quot; It &apos;s the way of our times , eh ?
<unk> , to be poisoned in your drink .
<unk> , to be poisoned in your food .
The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between .
Here &apos;s a new one for you : the gom jabbar .
It kills only animals . &quot;
<unk> overcame Paul &apos;s fear .
&quot; You dare suggest a duke &apos;s son is an animal ? &quot;
he demanded .
&quot; Let us say I suggest you may be human , &quot; she said .
&quot; <unk> !
I warn you not to try jerking away .
I am old , but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me . &quot;
&quot; Who are you ? &quot;
he whispered .
&quot; How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you ?
Are you from the Harkonnens ? &quot;
&quot; The Harkonnens ?
Bless us , no !
Now , be silent . &quot;
A dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the <unk> urge to leap away .
&quot; Good , &quot; she said .
&quot; You pass the first test .
Now , here &apos;s the way of the rest of it : If you withdraw your hand from the box you die .
This is the only rule .
Keep your hand in the box and live .
Withdraw it and die . &quot;
Paul took a deep breath to still his trembling .
&quot; If I call out there &apos;ll be servants on you in seconds and you &apos;ll die . &quot;
&quot; Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door .
Depend on it .
Your mother survived this test .
Now it &apos;s your turn .
Be honored .
We seldom administer this to <unk> . &quot;
<unk> reduced Paul &apos;s fear to a <unk> level .
He heard truth in the old woman &apos;s voice , no <unk> it .
If his mother stood guard out there .
.
.
if this were truly a test .
.
.
And whatever it was , he knew himself caught in it , trapped by that hand at his neck : the gom jabbar .
He recalled the response from the <unk> against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit rite .
&quot; I must not fear .
Fear is the mind-killer .
Fear is the <unk> that brings total obliteration .
I will face my fear .
I will permit it to pass over me and through me .
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path .
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing .
Only I will remain . &quot;
He felt calmness return , said : &quot; Get on with it , old woman . &quot;
&quot; Old woman ! &quot;
she snapped .
&quot; You &apos;ve courage , and that can &apos;t be denied .
Well , we shall see , <unk> . &quot;
She bent close , lowered her voice almost to a whisper .
&quot; You will feel pain in this hand within the box .
Pain .
But !
Withdraw the hand and I &apos;ll touch your neck with my gom jabbar -- the death so swift it &apos;s like the fall of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you .
<unk> ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s in the box ? &quot;
&quot; Pain . &quot;
He felt increased tingling in his hand , pressed his lips tightly together .
How could this be a test ?
he wondered .
The tingling became an <unk> .
The old woman said ; &quot; You &apos;ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap ?
There &apos;s an animal kind of trick .
A human would remain in the trap , endure the pain , feigning death that he might kill the <unk> and remove a threat to his kind . &quot;
The <unk> became the faintest burning .
&quot; Why are you doing this ? &quot;
he demanded .
&quot; To determine if you &apos;re human .
Be silent . &quot;
Paul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in the other hand .
It mounted slowly : heat upon heat upon heat .
.
.
upon heat .
He felt the <unk> of his free hand biting the palm .
He tried to <unk> the fingers of the burning hand , but couldn &apos;t move them .
&quot; It <unk> , &quot; he whispered .
&quot; Silence ! &quot;
Pain throbbed up his arm .
<unk> stood out on his forehead .
Every fiber cried out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit .
.
.
but .
.
.
the gom jabbar .
Without turning his head , he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle poised beside his neck .
He sensed that he was breathing in <unk> , tried to slow his breaths and couldn &apos;t .
Pain !
His world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony , the ancient face inches away staring at him .
His lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them .
The burning !
The burning !
He thought he could feel skin curling black on that <unk> hand , the flesh <unk> and dropping away until only <unk> bones remained .
It stopped !
As though a switch had been turned off , the pain stopped .
Paul felt his right arm trembling , felt sweat <unk> his body .
&quot; Enough , &quot; the old woman muttered .
&quot; Kull wahad !
No woman child ever <unk> that much .
I must &apos;ve wanted you to fail . &quot;
She leaned back , <unk> the gom jabbar from the side of his neck .
&quot; Take your hand from the box , young human , and look at it . &quot;
He fought down an aching <unk> , stared at the <unk> void where his hand seemed to remain of its own <unk> .
Memory of pain inhibited every movement .
<unk> told him he would withdraw a <unk> <unk> from that box .
&quot; Do it ! &quot;
she snapped .
He jerked his hand from the box , stared at it <unk> .
Not a mark .
No sign of agony on the flesh .
He held up the hand , turned it , flexed the fingers .
&quot; Pain by nerve <unk> , &quot; she said .
&quot; Can &apos;t go around <unk> potential humans .
There &apos;re those who &apos;d give a pretty for the secret of this box , though . &quot;
She slipped it into the folds of her gown .
&quot; But the pain -- &quot; he said .
&quot; Pain , &quot; she <unk> .
&quot; A human can override any nerve in the body . &quot;
Paul felt his left hand aching , <unk> the clenched fingers , looked at four bloody marks where <unk> had <unk> his palm .
He dropped the hand to his side , looked at the old woman .
&quot; You did that to my mother once ? &quot;
&quot; Ever <unk> sand through a screen ? &quot;
she asked .
The <unk> slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness : Sand through a screen , he nodded .
&quot; We Bene Gesserit <unk> people to find the humans . &quot;
He lifted his right hand , willing the memory of the pain .
&quot; And that &apos;s all there is to it -- pain ? &quot;
&quot; I observed you in pain , lad .
Pain &apos;s merely the axis of the test .
Your mother &apos;s told you about our ways of observing .
I see the signs of her teaching in you .
Our test is <unk> and observation . &quot;
He heard the <unk> in her voice , said : &quot; It &apos;s truth ! &quot;
She stared at him .
He senses truth !
Could he be the one ?
Could he truly be the one ?
She extinguished the excitement , reminding herself : &quot; <unk> clouds observation . &quot;
&quot; You know when people believe what they say , &quot; she said .
&quot; I know it . &quot;
The harmonics of ability <unk> by repeated test were in his voice .
She heard them , said : &quot; Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach .
Sit down , little brother , here at my feet . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to stand . &quot;
&quot; Your mother sat at my feet once . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not my mother . &quot;
&quot; You hate us a little , eh ? &quot;
She looked toward the door , called out : &quot; Jessica ! &quot;
The door flew open and Jessica stood there staring <unk> into the room .
<unk> <unk> from her as she saw Paul .
She managed a faint smile .
&quot; Jessica , have you ever stopped <unk> me ? &quot;
the old woman asked .
&quot; I both love and hate you , &quot; Jessica said .
&quot; The hate -- that &apos;s from pains I must never forget .
The love -- that &apos;s .
.
. &quot;
&quot; Just the basic fact , &quot; the old woman said , but her voice was gentle .
&quot; You may come in now , but remain silent .
Close that door and mind it that no one <unk> us . &quot;
Jessica stepped into the room , closed the door and stood with her back to it .
My son lives , she thought .
My son lives and is .
.
.
human .
I knew he was .
.
.
but .
.
.
he lives .
Now , I can go on living .
The door felt hard and real against her back .
Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her senses .
My son lives .
Paul looked at his mother .
She told the truth .
He wanted to get away alone and think this experience through , but knew he could not leave until he was dismissed .
The old woman had gained a power over him .
They spoke truth .
His mother had undergone this test .
There must be terrible purpose in it .
.
.
the pain and fear had been terrible .
